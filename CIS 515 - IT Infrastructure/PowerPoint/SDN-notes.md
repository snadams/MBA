# Software-Defined networking notes

[VIDEO: What is software-defined networking (SDN)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5Gi2Bpd82M)

- researchers from standards
- bringing the tenets of virtualization to networking
- virtualize the network by separating control plane from data plane

## Use Cases

- networks can be spun up dynamically
- policies can be placed on separate networks
- microsegmentation
- organization of Internet of Things devices (IoT)

Things you have to do on a network to isolate a VM from others (manual).

- Create a new vLAN
- Create a new gateway
- Create firewall rules
- Configure BGP on edge routers

An SDN controller would be responsible for managing all of those tasks, in software.
