# Fundamental Financial Principles

1. The principle of **self-interested behavior**.  People act in their own self-interest and in their own financial self-interest.
2. The principle of **two-sided transactions**. For every buyer there is a seller.  This principle combined with the principle that both the buyer and seller are acting in their own self-interest tends to market markets very efficient, meaning that market prices tend to reflect all relevant information and assets tend to be appropriately priced.  If this was not true, the buyer and/or seller would act in their own self interest, and their actions would push the prices to a more efficient/appropriate level.
3. The **signaling principle** and the behavioral principle.  Actions convey information.  When all else fails, look what others are doing for guidance.
4. The principle of **valuable ideas** and **comparative advantage**.  Comparative advantage and/or valuable ideas can contribute to value creation.
5. The **options principle**.  Options are valuable and are often hidden.
6. The principle of **incremental benefits**.  Relate this to the economics topic of marginal analysis.  Financial decisions are based on incremental, aka marginal, analysis.
7. The principle of **risk-return trade-off**.  There is a pervasive trade-off.  Investors will not accept more expected risk, unless they expect to be compensated for it.  All risk is not equal, some can be easily diversified away.
8. The principle of **diversification**. On average, diversification is beneficial.
9. The principle of **capital market efficiency**.  Capital markets (i.e. market prices) reflect all relevant information quickly.  Assets tend to be appropriately priced based on the relevant information available to market participants.  It is hard to find exceptionally profitable investments.  Recall, both the buyers and sellers are acting in their own self interests.
10. The **time value of money** principle.  The value of cash flows (money) depends critically on time.
11. The principle that **cash is king**, not profits.  After Tax Cash flows (ATCF), not profits, create value.
12. The **agency problem** principle.  Agency problems, aka conflicts of interest, are pervasive.  Managers won't work for owners.
