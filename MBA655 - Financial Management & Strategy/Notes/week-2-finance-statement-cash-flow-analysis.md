## Textbook: *"Chapter 2: Financial Statement and Cash Analysis"*

- **accrual-based approach** - recording of revenues at the point of sale and costs when they are incurred, not necessarily when a firm receives or pays out cash
  - Used by accountants to construct financial statements
- **cash flow approach** - focuses on current and prospective inflows and outflows of cash
  - Financial managers uses this to make for analysis and decision making.

### Financial Statements

- SEC requires four key financial statements: balance sheet, income statement, statement of retained earnings, and statement of cash flows

#### Balance Sheet

- *Snapshot* view of the company's financial position at a specific moment in time
- Includes the following:
  - **Assets**
    - cash
    - marketable securities
    - accounts receivable (what the customers owe from sales made)
    - inventories (raw materials, work in process, finished goods)
    - property, plant, and equipment (PPE)
    - intangible assets (patents, trademarks, copyrights, etc.)
  - **Liabilities**
    - accounts payable
    - notes payable (short-term loans, typically from commercial banks)
    - accrued expenses (taxes owed, wages due employees)
    - long-term debt
  - **Stockholders equity**
    - preferred stock
    - common stock
    - retained earnings (total number of earnings has reinvested since inception)
    - treasury stock (value of shares firm holds in reserve)

#### Income Statement

- also known as the profit-and-loss statement (P&L)
- Gross profit = amount by which sales revenues exceed COGS
- Net income = pretax income - taxes
- If firm has preferred stock, it first deducts preferred stock dividends from net income, *earnings available for common stockholders*.
  - *Earnings available for common stockholders* is then divided by number of shares of common stock outstanding to produce earnings per share (EPS).
  - A dividend may be paid out to common stockholders and/or kept in retained earnings.
- Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)

#### Statement of Retained Earnings

(Retained Earnings)<sub>current</sub> = (Retained Earnings)<sub>past</sub> - Cash Dividends

**dividend payout ratio** - the fraction of current earnings available for common stockholders paid out as dividends

#### Statement of Cash Flows

- Isolates a firms' operating, investment, and financing cash flows and reconciles with changes in its cash and marketable securities during the year

#### Notes to Financial Statements

- Extremely useful to financial managers and analysts
- Provide detailed information on accounting policies, calculations, and transactions that underlie entries in the financial statements
- Can deal with firm's revenue recognition practices, income taxes, leases, employee compensation plans, etc.

### Cash Flow Analysis

- *Operating flows* are cash flows directly related to the production and sales of products and services.
- *Investment flows* are cash flows associated with the purchase of fixed assets and business equity.
- *Financing flows* are cash flows that result from debt and equity financing transactions.

**free cash flow** - amount of cash flow available to investors - *the providers of debt and equity capital*

  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=FCF=OCF-\Delta FA-(\Delta CA - \Delta AP - \Delta accruals)">

    - FA = change in gross fixed assets
    - CA = change in current assets
    - change in accounts payable
    - change in accrued expenses  

- Net operating profits after taxes (NOPAT) - firm's earning before interest and after taxes

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=NOPAT=EBIT\times(1-T)">

- Operating cash flow

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=OCF=NOPAT%2bDepreciation">

**noncash charges** - expenses that appear on the income statement but do involve an actual outlay of cash

- depreciation, amortization, and depletion allowances

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=FCF = OCF - Capital\ Expenditures %2b Depreciation-\Delta WC">

#### Inflows and Outflows of Cash

| Inflows | Outflows |
| --- | --- |
| decrease in any asset| increase in any asset|
| increase in any liability | decrease in any liability |
| Net income (profit after taxes) | Net loss |
| Depreciation and other noncash charges | Dividends paid |
| Sale of common or preferred stock | Repurchase of retirement or stock |

- Statement of cash flow provides the clearest and most complete view of cash coming in and out of the business.
- **net working capital** - current assets minus liabilities
  - measure of the firm's overall liquidity (i.e. higher values means greater solvency)

### Assessing Financial Performance Using Ratio Analysis

- **ratio analysis** - calculating and interpreting financial ratios to assess a firm's performance and status

#### Liquidity ratios

- Measures a firm's ability to satisfy its short-term obligations *as they come due*
- **current ratio** - measures the firms ability to meet its short term obligations

  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{Current\ Assets}{Current\ Liabilities}">

  - The more predictable a firm's cash flows, the  lower the acceptable current ratio
- **quick (acid-test) ratio** - similar to the current ratio, but excludes inventory (*least-liquid current asset*)
  
  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{Current\ Assets-Inventory}{Current\ Liabilities}">

  - provides a better measure of overall liquidity when a firm's inventory cannot be easily converted into cash

#### Activity ratios

- Measures the speed of which the firm converts various accounts in to sales or cash
- **inventory turnover** - measure of how quickly a firm sells its goods

  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{Cost\ Of\ Goods\ Sold}{Inventory}">

- *Average age of turnover* is:

  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{Inventory\ Turnover}{365}">

- Average collection period (*also known as average age of accounts receivable*)
  - If  a firm offered 45-day credit terms than a 46 day collection period would be acceptable.

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Average\ Daily\ Sales=\frac{Annual\ Sales}{365}=\frac{\$12,843}{365}=\$35.19">
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Average\ Collection\ Period=\frac{Account\ Receivables}{Average\ Daily\ Sales}=\frac{\$1,619}{\$35.19}=46.0\ days">

- **average payment period** - the average length of time it takes a firm to pay its suppliers

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Average\ Daily\ Purchases=\frac{Annual\ Purchases}{365}">
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Average\ Daily\ Purchases=\frac{Accounts\ Payable}{Average\ Daily\ Purchases}">

- **fixed asset turnover** - measures the efficiency in which a firm uses its *fixed assets*
  - tells how many dollars of sales the firms generates per dollar of investment in fixed assets

  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{Sales}{Net\ Fixed\ Assets}">

- **total asset turnover** - measures the efficiency with which a firm uses all of its assets to generate sales
  - Generally favor a higher turnover ratio

  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{Sales}{Total\ Assets}">

#### Debt Ratios

- Measure the extent to which a firm uses money from creditors rather than from stockholders to finance its operations
- **coverage ratios** - focus more on income statement measures of the firm's ability to generate sufficient cash flow to make scheduled interest and principal payments
- **debt ratio** - measures the proportion of total assets financed by the firm's creditors
  - Higher the ratio, greater the firm's reliance on borrowed money to finance activities

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{Total\ Liabilities}{Total\ Assets}">

- **assets-to-equity (A/E) ratio** - the amount that assets were greater than equity

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{Total\ Assets}{Common\ Stock\ Equity}">

- **debt-to-equity ratio** - percentage of debts in relation to stockholders' equity

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{Longterm\ Debt}{Stockholders'\ Equity}">

> *Both of these ratios use book values of debt, equity, and asset. Analysts should be aware that market values of these variables can be different from book.*

- **times interest earned ratio** - measures the firms ability to make contractual interest payments
  - The higher the better

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{Earnings\ before\ interest\ and\ taxes}{Interest\ Expense}">

#### Profitability Ratios

- **gross profit margin** - measures the percentage of each sales dollar remaining after the firm has paid for its goods

  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{Gross\ profit}{Sales}">

- **operating profit margin** - measures the percentage of each sales dollar remaining after deducting all costs and expenses *other than* interest and taxes  

  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{Operating\ profit}{Sales}">

- **net profit margin** - measures the percentage of each sales dollar remaining after deducting all costs and expenses, *including* interest, taxes, and preferred stock dividends

  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{Earnings\ available\ for\ common\ stockholders}{Sales}">

- **earnings per share** - represents the dollar amount *earned* on behalf of each share of common stock outstanding
  - Different from *dividends per share* which is the amount of earnings actually distributed to each shareholder

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{Earnings\ available\ for\ common\ stockholders}{Number\ of\ shares\ of\ common\ stock\ outstanding}">

- **return on total assets (ROA)** - measures management's overall effectiveness in using the firm's assets to generate returns to common stockholders
  - also known as *return on investment (ROI)*

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{Earnings\ available\ for\ common\ stockholders}{Total\ assets}">

- **return on common equity (ROE)** - captures the return earned on the common stockholders' (owners') investment in the firm

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{Earnings\ available\ for\ common\ stockholders}{Common\ stock\ equity}">

- ROA can be also be broken into components using the DuPont system.

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=ROA=Net\ profit\ margin\times Total\ asset\ turnover">

#### Market Ratios

- relate the firm's market value, as measured by its current share price, to certain accounting values
  - provide insight of how investors think the firm is performing
  - reflect the common stockholders' assessment of the firm's past and expected future performance
- **price/earnings (P/E) ratio** - measures the amount investors are willing to pay for each dollar of the firm's earnings
  - A high P/E ratio indicates investors' belief that a firm will achieve rapid earnings growth in the future, *i.e. growth stocks*

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{Market\ price\ per\ share\ of\ common\ stock}{Earnings\ per\ share}">

- **market/book (M/B) ratio** - relates the market value of the firm's shares to their book value

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Book\ value\ per\ share=\frac{Common\ stock\ equity}{Number\ of\ shares\ of\ common\ stock\ outstanding}">
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=M/B\ ratio=\frac{Market\ value\ per\ share\ of\ common\ stock}{Book\ value\ per\ share\ of\ common\ stock}">
