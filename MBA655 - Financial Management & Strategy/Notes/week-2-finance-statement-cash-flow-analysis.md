## Textbook: *"Chapter 2: Financial Statement and Cash Analysis"*

- **accrual-based approach** - recording of revenues at the point of sale and costs when they are incurred, not necessarily when a firm receives or pays out cash
  - Used by accountants to construct financial statements
- **cash flow approach** - focuses on current and prospective inflows and outflows of cash
  - Financial managers uses this to make for analysis and decision making.

### Financial Statements

- SEC requires four key financial statements: balance sheet, income statement, statement of retained earnings, and statement of cash flows

#### Balance Sheet

- *Snapshot* view of the company's financial position at a specific moment in time
- Includes the following:
  - **Assets**
    - cash
    - marketable securities
    - accounts receivable (what the customers owe from sales made)
    - inventories (raw materials, work in process, finished goods)
    - property, plant, and equipment (PPE)
    - intangible assets (patents, trademarks, copyrights, etc.)
  - **Liabilities**
    - accounts payable
    - notes payable (short-term loans, typically from commercial banks)
    - accrued expenses (taxes owed, wages due employees)
    - long-term debt
  - **Stockholders equity**
    - preferred stock
    - common stock
    - retained earnings (total number of earnings has reinvested since inception)
    - treasury stock (value of shares firm holds in reserve)

#### Income Statement

- also known as the profit-and-loss statement (P&L)
- Gross profit = amount by which sales revenues exceed COGS
- Net income = pretax income - taxes
- If firm has preferred stock, it first deducts preferred stock dividends from net income, *earnings available for common stockholders*.
  - *Earnings available for common stockholders* is then divided by number of shares of common stock outstanding to produce earnings per share (EPS).
  - A dividend may be paid out to common stockholders and/or kept in retained earnings.
- Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)

#### Statement of Retained Earnings

(Retained Earnings)<sub>current</sub> = (Retained Earnings)<sub>past</sub> - Cash Dividends

**dividend payout ratio** - the fraction of current earnings available for common stockholders paid out as dividends

#### Statement of Cash Flows

- Isolates a firms' operating, investment, and financing cash flows and reconciles with changes in its cash and marketable securities during the year

#### Notes to Financial Statements

- Extremely useful to financial managers and analysts
- Provide detailed information on accounting policies, calculations, and transactions that underlie entries in the financial statements
- Can deal with firm's revenue recognition practices, income taxes, leases, employee compensation plans, etc.

### Cash Flow Analysis

- *Operating flows* are cash flows directly related to the production and sales of cash.
- *Investment flows* are cash flows associated with the purchase of fixed assets and business equity.
- *Financing flows* are cash flows that result from debt and equity financing transactions.

**free cash flow** - amount of cash flow available to investors - *the providers of debt and equity capital*

    - FA = change in gross fixed assets
    - CA = change in current assets
    - change in accounts payable
    - change in accrued expenses  

- Net operating profits after taxes (NOPAT) - firm's earning before interest and after taxes

- Operating cash flow

**noncash charges** - expenses that appear on the income statement but do involve an actual outlay of cash

- depreciation, amortization, and depletion allowances

#### Inflows and Outflows of Cash

| Inflows | Outflows |
| --- | --- |
| decrease in any asset| increase in any asset|
| increase in any liability | decrease in any liability |
| Net income (profit after taxes) | Net loss |
| Depreciation and other noncash charges | Dividends paid |
| Sale of common or preferred stock | Repurchase of retirement or stock |

- Statement of cash flow provides the clearest and most complete view of cash coming in and out of the business.
- **net working capital** - current assets minus liabilities
  - measure of the firm's overall liquidity (i.e. higher values means greater solvency)

### Assessing Financial Performance Using Ratio Analysis

- **ratio analysis** - calculating and interpreting financial ratios to assess a firm's performance and status

#### Liquidity ratios

- Measures a firm's ability to satisfy its short-term obligations *as they come due*
