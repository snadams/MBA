- **accrual-based approach** - recording of revenues at the point of sale and costs when they are incurred, not necessarily when a firm receives or pays out cash
  - Used by accountants to construct financial statements
- **cash flow approach** - focuses on current and prospective inflows and outflows of cash
  - Financial managers uses this to make for analysis and decision making.

### Financial Statements

- SEC requires four key financial statements: balance sheet, income statement, statement of retained earnings, and statement of cash flows

#### Balance Sheet

- *Snapshot* view of the company's financial position at a specific moment in time
- Includes the following:
  - **Assets**
    - cash
    - marketable securities
    - accounts receivable (what the customers owe from sales made)
    - inventories (raw materials, work in process, finished goods)
    - property, plant, and equipment (PPE)
    - intangible assets (patents, trademarks, copyrights, etc.)
  - **Liabilities**
    - accounts payable
    - notes payable (short-term loans, typically from commercial banks)
    - accrued expenses (taxes owed, wages due employees)
    - long-term debt
  - **Stockholders equity**
    - preferred stock
    - common stock
    - retained earnings (total number of earnings has reinvested since inception)
    - treasury stock (value of shares firm holds in reserve)

#### Income Statement

- also known as the profit-and-loss statement (P&L)
- Gross profit = amount by which sales revenues exceed COGS
- Net income = pretax income - taxes
- If firm has preferred stock, it first deducts preferred stock dividends from net income, *earnings available for common stockholders*.
  - *Earnings available for common stockholders* is then divided by number of shares of common stock outstanding to produce earnings per share (EPS).
  - A dividend may be paid out to common stockholders and/or kept in retained earnings.

#### Statement of Retained Earnings

(Retained Earnings)<sub>current</sub> = (Retained Earnings)<sub>past</sub> - Cash Dividends
