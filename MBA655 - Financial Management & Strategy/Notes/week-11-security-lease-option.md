# Week 1

## Chapter 15 - Payout Policy

### Cash Dividends

* A firm's *payout policy* describes the choices its managers make about distributing cash to shareholders.
  * Choice include a regular (recurring) dividend or a one-time "special dividend
  * No legal guarantee that a shareholder will receive dividends

**dividend yield**: annual cash dividend divided by the current stock price
**dividend payout ratio**: dividends paid divided by earnings in a given period

* To received a dividend, a shareholder must be a *shareholder of record* on the **date of record.** Because of bookkeeping entries, an investor must own the stock before the **ex-dividend date**, usually two business days prior to record date. **Payment date** is usually a few weeks after the record date.
  * In the absence of market imperfections, when a stock goes ex-dividend, its price should drive by the amount of the dividend. However, this usually turns out to be less typically because of taxes.

**stock dividend**: a transaction that increases the number of shares that existing stockholders own

* A 20% stock dividend would issue 20 new shares for every 100 shares that an investor owns. Stockholders do not get 20% wealthier, because stock price reacts to amount of shares outstanding.

**stock split**: similar to stock dividend, its share price declines because the number of outstanding shares increase

* Typically done by managers to restore the per-share price of the firm's stock to within a "preferred range" that individual investors desire
  * Also does not mean an increased value. Exchanging a \$10 for 2 \$5s does not increase value.

**reverse stock split**: transaction where a firm replaces a certain number of outstanding shares with just one new share

### Stock Repurchases

Companies can use several methods to repurchase shares:

* **open-market share repurchase**: firms buy their shares in the open market
* **tender offer (or self-tender)**: firms offer to buy back a certain number of shares, usually at a premium above the current market price
* **Dutch auction repurchase**: firms ask investors to submit prices at which they are willing to sell their shares

### Dividend Patterns

1. Firms have long-run target dividend payout ratios.
2. Dividend changes follow shifts in long-run, sustainable earnings (not a short-run changes in earnings).
3. Managers are reluctant to increase dividends if they might have to be cut late.
4. Managers focus on dividend changers rather than on dividend levels.

### Miller and Modigliani Meet the (Imperfect) Real World

* Even though dividend payments are irrelevant (in a perfect world), managers still rate payout policy is more important than investment decisions. This can happen because of different reasons:
  * **Taxes.** Depending on government legislation, taxes paid on dividends can equal capital gains (sale/repurchase of stock) or be dramatically more. This can affect decisions on whether dividends are paid or repurchases are used.
  * **Agency cost.** Agency problems rarely exist in privately owned problems and usually crop up in public firms that are are large and mature. Shareholders typically respond more to managers who commit to pay out free cash flow (through dividends or stock repurchase).
  * **Signaling model.** If managers know their firm is strong, they pay dividends (or repurchase shares) to signal their firm's quality to marketplace.
    * It is costly for a weak firm to mimic this action.
  * **Catering theory.** Predicts that corporate managers cater to investor preferences by paying dividends when investors assign a discount to dividend payers.

These theories only account for some and don't explain payout policies for the broad cross-section of employees.

## Chapter 16 - Investment Banking and the Public Sale of Equity Securities

**investment bank**: helps corporate managers raise external capital and to raise equity rather than debt

Services that investment banks offer:

* Managing security offerings
* Provide advice for mergers and acquisitions (M&A)
* Help syndicate loans

Their three principal lines of business are:

* Corporate finance
  * Includes security underwriting and M&A advisory work
* Trading
  * They can act as a dealer, facilitating trade between unrelated parties and earning fees in return.
  * They hold inventories of securities and can make (or lose) money as inventory values fluctuate.
* Asset management
  * Include managing money for individuals with high net worth, operating and advising mutual funds, and managing pension funds.
  * Revenues from this line of business typically exceeds the other lines.

### Investment Banker Role in Equity Issues

Firms can issue stocks without the assistance of investment bankers, but almost all firms hire IBs to help issue equity.

**negotiated offer**: issuing firm negotiates the terms of the offer directly with one investment bank
**competitively bid offer**: firm announces the terms of its intended equity sale and then investment banks bid for the business

* Not necessarily cheaper. Vast majority of equity sales are negotiated.

Firms often hire more than one investment bank. One of the banks is usually called the **lead underwriter**, while the other banks are called **co-managers**.

* This is typically done because it is believed that a larger number of stock analysts will follow the firm after the offering.

Investment bankers must sell equity under two types of contracts:

* **best-efforts offering**: bank promises to give its best effort to sell the firm's securities at the agreed-upon price but makes no guarantee about the ultimate success of the offering
* **firm-commitment offering**: bank agrees to underwrite the issue, meaning that the bank guarantees (underwrites) the offering prices
  * Entails of actually purchasing sales from firm and reselling them to investors.
  * The risk for the bank can be mitigated by forming an *underwriting syndicate* that consists of many banks, spreading the risk among many banks.They also determine demand set the offer price, meaning they have a good idea that will be able to resell the shares.

### Benefits of Going Public

1. New capital for the company.
2. Publicly traded stock for use in acquisitions.
   * Companies have the ability to exchange its own stock for that of another firm.
3. Listed stock for use as a compensation vehicle (incentive for mangers).
4. Personal wealth and liquidity.

### Drawbacks of Going Public

1. The financial costs of an IPO.
   * Include accounting, printing, and legal services and must be paid even if the offering is postponed or canceled.
2. The managerial costs of an IPO.
   * Demands on CEO and managers as offering date approaches, restrictions on what can be said or done in pre-offering period.
3. Stock price emphasis.
   * External pressures build to maximize the firm's stock price.
4. Life in a fishbowl.
   * Shareholders have the right to a great deal of information about a firm's internal affairs, which could also be release to competitors and potential acquirers.

## Chapter 17 - Long-Term Debt and Leasing

### Leasing

**leasing**: requires a company to make a series of periodic, tax-deductible payments that may be fixed or variable

* The **lessee** uses the underlying asset and makes regular payments to the **lessor**, who retains ownership of the asset.

**operating lease**: a contractual arrangement whereby the lessee agrees to make periodic payments to the lessor, often for five years or less, to obtain an asset's services. Lessee receives an option to cancel the lease by paying a cancellation fee.
  
* When the lease expires, the lessee returns the asset to the lessor, who may lease it again or sell it.
* The lessor's original costs generally exceed the total value of the initial lessee's payments.

**financial (or capital) lease**: generally longer than an operating lease and noncancelable. Even if the lessee no longer needs the asset, payments must continue until the lease expires.

* Typically used for land, buildings, and other large pieces of equipment.
* Total payments over the lease period are greater than the lessor's initial cost.

The three primary techniques used for lessors to obtain assets for leasing include:

* **direct lease**: results when a lessor acquires the assets that leased to a given lessee
* **sale-leaseback arrangement**: one firm sell as an asset to another for cash and then leases the asset from its new owner.
* **leveraged leases**: the lessor acts as a equity participant, supplying only about 20% of the asset's cost and borrowing the balance of the funds.

A lease agreement usually specifies whether or not the lessee is responsible for the maintenance of the leased assets in the **maintenance clause**.

* In operating leases, the costs are typically the lessor's responsibility.
* May also include **renewal options** to renew for shorter terms or **purchase options** to purchase the leased asset at maturity of the lease.

The choices in *lease-versus-purchase* decision:

* Lease the assets.
* Borrow funds to purchase the assets.
* Purchase the assets using available liquid resources.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Leasing

#### Advantages

1. Leasing allows the lessee, in effect, to depreciate land, which is prohibited if the land is purchased.
2. The use of sale-leaseback arrangements may permit the firm to increase its liquidity by converting an issue into cash, which can then be used as working capital.
3. Leasing provides 100% financing, doesn't require a down payment where you are only receiving 90% or 95% of financing.
4. When a firm becomes bankrupt or is reorganized, the maximum claim of lessors against the corporation is three years of lease payments and the lessor reclaims the asset.
5. In a lease arrangement, the firm may avoid the cost of obsolescence if the lessor fails to accurately anticipate the obsolescence of assets and sets the lease payment too low.
6. A lessee avoids many of the negative covenants includes as a part of a long-term loan.
7. In the case of low-cost assets that infrequently acquired, leasing may provide the firm with needed financing flexibility.

#### Disadvantages

1. A lease does not have a stated interest cost. Lessee could be better of borrowing to purchase the asset.
2. At the end of the term of the lease agreement, the lessor realizes the salvage value, if any.
3. Under a lease, the lessee is generally prohibited from making improvements on the lease property or asset without the lessor's approval.
4. If a lessee leases an asset that subsequently becomes obsolete, it still must make lease payments over the remaining term of the lease, even it if the asset is unusable.

## Chapter 18 - Options Basics

**options**: allow investors to buy or sell an asset at a fixed price during a given period of time

**deriviative security**: a security that derives its value from another asset

* An option falls under this category because its value depends on the price of the underlying stock that the option holder can buy or sell at a fixed price.

**call option**: grants the right to purchase a share of stock (or some other asset) at a fixed price on or before a fixed date

* **strike price**: the price at which a call option allows an investor to purchase the underlying share (or exercise price)
* The more the underlying stock price increases the more valuable the option becomes.
* Usually only available for a fairly short period, up to an option's expiration date. American call option allows the right to purchase on or before expiration date. European call option grants that right only on the expiration date.

**put option**: grants the right to sell a share of stock at a fixed price on or before a certain date

* Becomes more valuable as the underlying stock price decreases.
* Comes in American and European varieties

Option buyer = long position
Option seller = short position
