## Chapter 12 - Capital Structure: Theory and Taxes

**capital structure**: refers to the mix of debt and equity securities that a firm issues to finance its activities

* High-tech companies whose primary assets tend to be intangible (intellectual property) tend to have little debt. Companies in stable markets or large investments in assets with active secondary markets have higher debt levels.

**financial leverage**: borrowed money

* A company with debt is known as a *levered* firm. A company funded 100% with equity is an *unlevered* firm.
* Leveraging magnifies both good and bad outcomes.
* If a firm can earn more on its assets then it pays on its debt, EPS goes up relative to all-equity case.

**recapitalization**: strategy used to improve financial stability or overhaul its financial structure by changing the debt to equity ratio

The **fundamental principal of financial leverage** is that substituting debt for equity increases expected returns to shareholders but also increases the risk that equity investors bear.

### The Modigliani & Miller (M&M) Propositions

#### Proposition I

* Asserts that a firm's total market value equals the value of its assets and is independent of the firm's capital structure, also known as the *irrelevance proposition*

* Equation states that firm's market value equals the present value of the cash flows it generates regardless of the capital structure it chooses. Can be found by capitalizing its expected net operating income (NOI) at the rate r(A) (return on assets).
* This proposition was proved by using a no-arbitrage argument (i.e. no buying an asset and immediately selling it at a different price for a risk-free profit).

#### Proposition II

* Asserts that the expected return on a levered firm's equity, r(l), increases with the debt-to-equity ratio.

### M&M and Taxes

Present value of interest tax shield

* The value of a leveraged company equals the value modified to discount after-tax net income plus the interest tax shield.
* Based on these findings, being leveraged increases firm value? Why shouldn't firms leverage 100% to decrease the amount owed to government?
  * There are arguments that the debt tax advantage over equity at the corporate level might be partially or fully offset by tax disadvantage at the individual level.

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=G_L=\{1-[\frac{(1-T_c)(1-T_{ps})}{1-T_{pd}}]\}D">

* G(L) = gains from using leverage
* T(c) = tax rate on corporate profits
* T(ps) = personal tax rate on income from stock (dividends and capital gain)
* T(pd) = personal tax rate on income from debt (interest income)
* D = market value of a firm's outstanding debt

**nondebt tax shields**: substitutes for debts in corporate financial structure (deductions)

#### Checklist of How Taxes affect Capital Structure

1. The higher the corporate income tax rate, the more debt companies will use in equilibrium.
2. The higher the personal tax rate on equity-related investment income (dividends and capital gains), the more debt companies will use in equilibrium.
3. The higher the personal tax rate on interest income, the less debt companies will use in equilibrium.
4. The more nondebt tax shields a company has, the less debt it will use in equilibrium.

## Chapter 13 - Capital Structure: Balancing the Benefits and Costs of Debt

### Debt Tax Shields and Firm Profitability

* The more debt a firm uses, the higher are the interest expenses that the firm must pay, and therefore the greater the likelihood that the firm will experience losses in at least some years.

### Costs of Bankruptcy

**bankruptcy**: legal process used to handle the process when an entity cannot meet its debt obligations

Bankruptcy costs fall into two categories:

* *Direct bankruptcy costs* include fees paid to attorneys, accountants, investment bankers, and other professionals involved in proceedings in addition to other expenses directly tied to bankruptcy filing and administration
* *Indirect bankruptcy costs* include the loss of customers and key suppliers, time managers devote to bankruptcy process instead of core business, and missed opportunities to invest in positive-NPV projects.

* V(L) = value of a levered firm
* V(U) = value of an unlevered firm

* Customers would be unlikely to abandon a firm in financial distress whose product required little or no service, or typically sold without a warranty (i.e. fast food restaurants, grocery stores). More debt can be employed.
* Firms like Google or other high-tech firms viabilities depend on long-lived, complex products that customers will worry that no one will be able to replace the service if it goes bankrupt. Less debt is employed.

### Agency Costs and Capital Structure

* Debt helps firms overcome the *agency costs of outside equity*.
  * Using debt means a firm can sell less external equity and still finance its operations.
  * Reduces managerial perquisite (perk) consumption because they need to make regular debt-service payments. Excessive perk consumption might cause a loss of the company.
* Equity helps firms overcome the *agency costs of outside debt*.
  * **asset substitution**: promising to invest in a safe asset to obtain a return reflecting low risk but then substituting a riskier asset that offers the possibility of a higher return
    * This arises from the fact that if companies are in financial distress, shareholders have everything to gain on a gamble that can net a profit, than playing it safe in an investment that only affects debt holders.
  * **underinvestment**: when a leveraged company foregos valuable investment opportunities because debt holders would capture a portion of the benefits of the project, leaving insufficient returns to shareholders

Trade-off model expresses a levered firm's value in terms of an unlevered firm's value as adjusted for by the present values of tax shield, bankruptcy costs, and the agency costs of debt and equity.

Implications from the trade-off model include:

* Profitable firms should borrow more than unprofitable firms as they are more likely to benefit from debt tax shields.
* Firms that own tangible, marketable assets should borrow more than firms whose assets are intangible or highly specialized.
* Safer firms should borrow more than riskier firms.
* Companies should have a target capital structure.

### The Pecking-Order Theory

There are two empirical regularities that are inconsistent with the trade-off model:

1. The most profitable firms in an industry have the lowest debt ratios.
2. Firms issue debt frequently, but equity issues are rare. They are often greeted with a large decline in the firm's stock price.

The pecking order theory is based on four facts:

1. Dividend policy is "sticky". Managers tend to maintain a stable dividend payment, neither increasing nor decreasing in response to fluctuations in profit.
2. Firms prefer internal financing (profits and retained cash) to external financing of any sort (debt or equity).
3. If a firm must obtain external financing, it will issue the safest security first.
4. If a firm requires more external financing, it will work down the "pecking order of securities:
   * Safe debt
   * Risky debt
   * Convertible securities
   * Preferred stock
   * common stock

**financial slack**: a firm's cash and marketable securities holdings in addition to its unused debt capacity

### Signaling and Market-Timing Models

* One way to solve information asymmetry between managers and investors is by signaling good news. They could do this by adopting a heavily leveraged capital structure *signaling* to investors that only firms with good prospects can tak on debt.
* Market-timing models refer to issuing equity when share values are high and issuing debt when they are not.
