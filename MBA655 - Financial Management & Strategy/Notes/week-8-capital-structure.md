## Chapter 12 - Capital Structure: Theory and Taxes

**capital structure**: refers to the mix of debt and equity securities that a firm issues to finance its activities

* High-tech companies whose primary assets tend to be intangible (intellectual property) tend to have little debt. Companies in stable markets or large investments in assets with active secondary markets have higher debt levels.

**financial leverage**: borrowed money

* A company with debt is known as a *levered* firm. A company funded 100% with equity is an *unlevered* firm.
* Leveraging magnifies both good and bad outcomes.
* If a firm can earn more on its assets then it pays on its debt, EPS goes up relative to all-equity case.

**recapitalization**: strategy used to improve financial stability or overhaul its financial structure by changing the debt to equity ratio

The **fundamental principal of financial leverage** is that substituting debt for equity increases expected returns to shareholders but also increases the risk that equity investors bear.

### The Modigliani & Miller (M&M) Propositions

#### Proposition I

* Asserts that a firm's total market value equals the value of its assets and is independent of the firm's capital structure, also known as the *irrelevance proposition*

* Equation states that firm's market value equals the present value of the cash flows it generates regardless of the capital structure it chooses. Can be found by capitalizing its expected net operating income (NOI) at the rate r(A) (return on assets).
* This proposition was proved by using a no-arbitrage argument (i.e. no buying an asset and immediately selling it at a different price for a risk-free profit).

#### Proposition II

* Asserts that the expected return on a levered firm's equity, r(l), increases with the debt-to-equity ratio.

### M&M and Taxes

Present value of interest tax shield

* The value of a leveraged company equals the value modified to discount after-tax net income plus the interest tax shield.
* Based on these findings, being leveraged increases firm value? Why shouldn't firms leverage 100% to decrease the amount owed to government?
  * There are arguments that the debt tax advantage over equity at the corporate level might be partially or fully offset by tax disadvantage at the individual level.

* G(L) = gains from using leverage
* T(c) = tax rate on corporate profits
* T(ps) = personal tax rate on income from stock (dividends and capital gain)
* T(pd) = personal tax rate on income from debt (interest income)
* D = market value of a firm's outstanding debt

**nondebt tax shields**: substitutes for debts in corporate financial structure (deductions)

#### Checklist of How Taxes affect Capital Structure

1. The higher the corporate income tax rate, the more debt companies will use in equilibrium.
2. The higher the personal tax rate on equity-related investment income (dividends and capital gains), the more debt companies will use in equilibrium.
3. The higher the personal tax rate on interest income, the less debt companies will use in equilibrium.
4. The more nondebt tax shields a company has, the less debt it will use in equilibrium.
