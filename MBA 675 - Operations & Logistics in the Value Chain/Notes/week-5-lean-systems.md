## Chapter 6: Lean Systems

**lean systems**: operations systems that maximize the value added by each of a company's activities by removing waste and delays from them

* Is important to a number of departments and functional areas across the organization:
  * Marketing relies on lean systems to deliver high-quality services or products on time and at reasonable prices
  * Human Resources must put in the right incentive system for a flexible workforce who can successfully operate a lean system
  * Engineering must design products that use use common parts, so that fewer setups and focused factories can be used
  * Operations must maintain close ties with suppliers, design the lean system and using it in the production of services or goods
  * Accounting must adjust its billing and cost accounting practices to provide the support needed to manage lean systems
  * Management must embrace the lean philosophy and make it a part of organizational culture and learning

### Continuous Improvement Using a Lean Systems Approach

**just-in-time (JIT) philosophy**: the belief that waste can be eliminated by cutting unnecessary capacity or inventory and removing nonvalue-added activities in operations

The eight types of waste (*muda*) include:

1. Overproduction - Manufacturing an item before it is needed, making it difficult to detect defects and creating excessive lead times and inventory.
2. Inappropriate processing - Using expensive high-precision equipment when simpler machines would suffice. Leads to overutilization of expensive capital assets.
3. Waiting - Unbalanced workstations make operators lose time, because if a process step takes longer than the next, then the operator will either stand idly waiting, or they will be performing their tasks at a speed that make it appear that they have work to complete.
4. Transportation - Excessive movement and material handling of product between processes, which can cause damage and deterioration of product quality without adding any significant customer value.
5. Motion - Unnecessary effort related to the ergonomics of bending, stretching, reaching, lifting, and walking. Jobs with excessive motion should be redesigned.
6. Inventory - Excess inventory hides problems on the shop floor, consumes space, increases lead times, and inhibits communication. Work-in-process inventory is a direct result of overproduction and waiting.
7. Defects - Quality defects result in a rework and scrap and add wasteful costs to the system in the form of lost capacity, rescheduling effort, increased inspection, and loss of customer good will.
8. Underutilization of employees - Failure of the firm to learn from and capitalize on its employees' knowledge and creativity impedes long-term efforts to eliminate waste.

**JIT system**: a system that organizes the resources, information flows, and decision rules that enable a firm to realize the benefits of JIT principles

* By spotlighting areas that need improvement, lean systems lead to continuous improvement in quality and productivity (kaizen).
  * Excess capacity or inventory hides underlying problems with the processes that produce a service or product.
  * A typical kaizen tactic is cut inventories/resources to expose problems at the plant/service operation, record, and later fix. Then the inventories/resources are cut permanently to that level.

### Strategic Characteristics of Lean Systems

#### Supply Chain Considerations in Lean Systems

Two salient characteristics of lean systems that are related to creating and managing material flows in a supply chain:

* *Close supplier ties*. Because lean systems operate with low levels of capacity slack or inventory, a close relationship with suppliers is a must.
  * Supplies must be shipped frequently, have short lead times, arrive on schedule, and be of high quality.
  * Works out for both parties:
    * Suppliers have more inventory planning and delivery scheduling, which improves profit margins
    * Customers can negotiate lower component prices.
  * This can't be done if suppliers are viewed as adversaries, but partners.
  * Easier to do if there are a smaller amount of suppliers and they are in close geographic proximity.
* *Small lot sizes*.
  * **lot**: a quantity of items that are processed together.
  * Benefits include:
    * Small lots have the advantage of reducing the average level of inventory relative to large lots.
    * They pass through the system faster than large lots since they do not keep materials waiting.
    * If any defects are found, large lots cause longer delays because the entire lot must be examined to find all the items that need rework.
  * Disadvantages include:
    * Smaller lots means increased setup frequency. Typically a setup takes the same time regardless of the size of the lot. This means that many small lots may result in waste of idle employees, equipment, and materials.
      * Must make setup times be very brief to be efficient.
      * **single-digit setup**: the goal of having a setup time of less than 10 minutes

#### Process Considerations in Lean Systems

* *Pull method of work flow*.
  * Managers have a choice as to the nature of material flows in a process or supply chain, namely:
    * **pull method**: a method in which customer demand activates production of the service or item
    * Most firms using lean operations use this method
    * **push method**: a method in which production of the item begins in advance of customer needs
    * The choice between push and pull methods is often situational. There is no one-size-fits-all.
* *Quality at the source*. Defects are caught and corrected where they are created.
  * **jidoka**: automatically stopping the process when something is wrong and then fixing the problems as the line itself as they occur
    * Represents a visual system whereby status of the system in terms of safety, quality, delivery, and cost performance relative to the goals for a given fabrication cell or workstation in an assembly line is clearly visible to workers on the floor at all times
    * The alternative is to push problems down the line to be resolved later, which is often ineffective.
  * **poka-yoke**: mistake-proofing methods aimed at designing fail-safe systems that minimize human error
  * **andon**: a system that gives machines and machine operators the ability to signal the occurrence of any abnormal conditions such as tool malfunction, shortage of parts, or the product being made outside the desired specifications
    * Can take the form of audio alarms, blinking lights, LCD text displays, or cords that can be pulled by workers to ask for help or stop the production line
* *Uniform workstation loads*.
  * For manufacturing can be achieved by assembling the same type and number of units each day.
  * **takt time**: cycle time needed to match the rate of production to the rate of sales or consumption
    * To produce 450 units in one shift of 480 minutes, the line must roll out a vehicle every ( 480/450 ) **1.067 minutes**.
  * **heijunka**: the leveling of production load by both volume and product mix
    * Does not build products to the actual flow of customer orders but levels out the volume of orders in a period so that the same amount and mix are being made ach day.
    * Two possible heijunka options include:
      * **mixed-model assembly**: a type of assembly that produces a mix of models in smaller lots
        * Find the ratio of products and assign it to smaller lots. If one needed to manufacture 200 Cs, 150 As, and 100 Hs, that can be reduce to many cycles of 4 Cs, 3 As, and 2 Hs.
      * Use a lot size of one and repeat the production schedule (i.e. C-H-C-A-C-A-C-H-A)
        * Only works if if the setup times are brief.
* *Standardized components and work methods*.
  * IN highly repetitive service operations, analyzing work methods and documenting improvements can gain great efficiencies.
* *Flexible workforce*.
  * A benefit of flexibility is the ability to shift workers between workstations to help relieve bottlenecks without the need for inventory buffers.
* *Automation*.
  * Benefits are greater profits, greater market share, or both because of the reduced costs.
  * More automation is not always good because humans can do some jobs better.
* *Five S practices*.
  * **Five S (SS)**: a methodology consisting of five workplace practices - sorting, straightening, shining, standardizing, and sustaining - that are conducive to visual controls and lean production
    * Sort: Separate needed items from unneeded items. Discard the unneeded.
    * Straighten: Neatly arrange what is left, with a place for everything and everything in its place.
    * Shine: Clean and wash the work area and make it shine.
    * Standardize: Establish schedules and methods of performing the cleaning and sorting.
    * Sustain: Create discipline to perform the first four S practices, whereby everyone understands, obeys, and practices the rules when in the plant. Implement mechanisms to sustain the gains by involving people and recognizing them through a performance measurement system.
* *Total productive maintenance*.
  * Also known as total preventive maintenance
  * Reduces the frequency and duration of machine downtime
  * While performing routine maintenance activities, test other machine parts that may need replaced. Cheaper to do than while dealing with a machine failure during production.

### Designing Lean System Layouts

Line flows are recommended in designing lean system layouts because the eliminate waste by reducing the frequency of setups.

**one-worker, multiple machines (OWMM) cell**: a one-person cell in which a worker operates several different machines simultaneously to achieve a line flow

**group technology (GT)**: an option for achieving line flow layouts with low volume processes; this technique creates cells not limited to just one worker and has a unique way of selecting work to be done by the cell

* Groups parts or products with similar characteristics into families and sets aside groups of machines for their production.
* Once grouped, organize machine tools to perform the basic processes on each cell.

### The Kanban System

**Kanban**: a Japanese word meaning "card" or "visible record" that refers to cards used to control the flow of production through a factory

General operating rules are as follows:

1. Each container must have a card.
2. The assembly line always withdraw materials from the fabrication cell. The fabrication cell never pushes parts to the assembly line because, sooner or later, parts will be supplied that are not yet needed for production.
3. Containers of parts must never be removed from a storage area without a Kanban first being posted on the receiving post.
4. The containers should always contain the same number of good parts. The use of nonstandard containers or irregularly filled containers disrupts the production flow of the assembly line.
5. Only nondefective parts should be passed along to the assembly line to make the best use of materials and worker's time (i.e. building quality at the source).
6. Total production should not exceed the total amount authorized on the Kanbans in the system.

WIP = work-in-process = (average demand rate)(average times a container spends in the manufacturing progress) + safety stock

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=WIP=\kappa\c=\overline{d}(\overline{\omega}%2b\overline{\rho})(1%2b\alpha)">

* kappa = number of containers for a part
* d = expected daily demand for the part, in units
* omega = average waiting time during the production process plus materials handling time per container, in fractions of the day
* rho = average processing time per container, in fractions of a day
* c = quantity in a standard container of the part
* alpha = a policy variable that adds safety stock  to cover for unexpected circumstances (Toyota uses a value of no more than 10%)

Cards aren't the only way to signal the need for more production of a part.

* Container system where the container itself is the signal device.
  * An empty container signals the need to fill it.
  * Used for containers that are specifically designed for a particular part and no other parts could accidentally be put in the container.
* Containerless system
  * McDonald's has information entered by order taker transmitted to the cooks and assemblers who produce the sandwiches. A burger is removed another one is made.

### Value Stream Mapping

**value stream mapping (VSM)**: a qualitative lean tool for eliminating waste or muda that involves a current state drawing, a future state drawing, and an implementation plan

* A current state map depicts how the process works now with actual process times and not information not obtained by firsthand observation.
* Once a current state map is done, analysts use principles of lean systems to create a future state with streamlined product flows.
* The last step is preparing and actively using an implementation plan to achieve the future state.

### Operational Benefits and Implementation Issues

While there are numerous benefits, issues do arise form the implementation of a lean system.

* *The human costs of lean systems*.
  * The regimentation that results from statistical process control to reduce variations can cause stress and make workers feel pushed, which reduces productivity.
  * They may also feel a loss of autonomy.
  * This can be mitigated by allowing slack in the system or promoting work teams that can determine their task assignments in their domains of responsibility.
* *Cooperation and trust*.
  * Cooperation becomes paramount between workforce and management, where historically this has been fairly adversarial.
* *Reward systems and labor classifications*.
  * Reward systems may need to be realigned to focus on lean system goals. A reward for number of parts made when their is lean system to reduce stock are in direct conflict.
  * Labor unions limit the ability to have a flexible workforce.
* *Schedule stability*.
* *Setups*.
  * Sometimes difficult to attain short setup times needed for smaller lot sizes.
* *Purchasing and logistics*.
  * Shipments must be reliable because low inventory. Plant could be shut down because of a lack of materials.
