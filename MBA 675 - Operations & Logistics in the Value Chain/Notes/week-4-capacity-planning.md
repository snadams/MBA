# Week 4

## Chapter 4: Capacity Planning

**capacity**: the maximum rate of output of a process or system

* Managers are responsible for ensuring that a firm can meet current and future demand

### Planning Long-Term Capacity

Long-term capacity plans cover at least two years in to the future.

Capacity can be expressed in one of two ways:

* *Output measures of capacity*. Best used when applied to individual processes within the firm or when the firm provides a relatively small number of standardized services and products.
  * Car manufacturing plant - number of cars produced per day
  * As the amount of customization and variety in the product mix increases, output-based measures become less useful.
* *Input measures of capacity*. Generally used for low-volume, flexible processes.
  * Custom furniture maker - number of workstations, number of workers
  * Still typically needs to be expressed as an output rate. Demand for furniture gets converted into labor hours and number of employees needed to fill those hours.

**utilization**: the degree to which equipment, space, or the workforce is being used, and is measured as the ratio of average output rate to maximum capacity (expressed as a percent)
