## Chapter 10: Operations Planning and Scheduling

**operations planning and scheduling**: the process of balancing supply with demand, from the aggregate level down to the short-term scheduling level

* lie at the core of supply chain integration
* It is so important because:
  * It requires managerial inputs from all of the firm's functions
  * Each function is affected by the plan
  * Each department and group has its own workforce (which must be planned and scheduled)
  * Schedules are part of everyday life

### Levels in Operations Planning and Scheduling

Managers develop plans for operations carrying varying time spans.

* Level 1 are long-term operational plans.
* Level 2 have resource plans, cover a shorter term, and are more detailed.
* Level 3 plans are the most detailed, covering short-term horizons and relate to specific products and resources.

#### Level 1: Sales and Operations Planning

These plans are important because they focus on a general course of action, consistent with company's strategic goals and objectives, without getting bogged won in details. To do this, companies must aggregate along three dimensions.

1. *Services or products*.
   * **product family**: a group of services or products that have similar demand requirements and common process, labor, and materials requirements
   * i.e. a bike manufacturer separating 12 bike models into two families - mountain bikes and road bikes
2. *Workforce*.
   * Can be aggregated in different ways depending on its flexibility
3. *Time*.
   * Planning horizon is usually 1 year
   * Adjustments are usually made monthly or quarterly to reduce expense and disruptive effect of frequent changes.

**business plan**: a projected statement of income, costs, and profits

**annual (or financial) plan**: a plan for financial assessment used by a nonprofit service organization

#### Level 2: Resource Planning

**resource planning**: a process that takes sales and operations plans, processes time standards, routings, and other information on how services or products are produced, and then plans the timing of capacity and material requirements

* Does this by decomposing the aggregate quantities of product families, workforce, and time
* **master production schedule**: specifies the timing and size of production quantities for each product

#### Level 3: Scheduling

Scheduling takes the resource plan and translates it into specific operational tasks on a detailed basis.

**workforce schedule**: details the specific work schedule for each category of employee

* Information flows in both directions from broad to detailed and detailed to broad. An adjustment in one level of a plan will affect the others down the path.

### S&OP Supply Options

Operations managers must develop a plan to meet demand. THere are six options that can be used singly or in combination to arrive at a plan.

1. *Anticipation inventory*.
   * Inventory used to absorb uneven rates of demand or supply
   * Can be costly to hold, especially if stocked as a finished good
   * When services/products are customized, usually not an option
2. *Workforce adjustment*.
   * Adjusted by hiring or laying off employees
   * Depending on the industry, this may be easy or difficult because of labor pool, seasonal nature, required skill
3. *Workforce utilization*.
   * **overtime**: the time that employees work that is longer than the regular workday or workweek for which they receive additional pay
     * Can avoid costly fringe benefits like insurance, social security, retirement funds
     * Excessive overtime can result in declining quality and productivity
   * **undertime**: the situation that occurs when employees do not have enough work for the regular-time workday or workweek
     * Labor capacity exceeds demand and the excess labor capacity can not be used to productively to build inventory or satisfy customer orders earlier than the delivery dates already promised
4. *Part-time workers*.
   * Common in low-skill positions
   * Typically do not receive fringe benefits
5. *Subcontractors*.
   * Used to overcome short-term capacity shortages
6. *Vacation schedules*.
   * Shut down production for a lull in sales or mandate that employees take vacation at certain times

### S&OP Strategies

**chase strategy**: a strategy that involves hiring and laying off employees to match the demand forecast

* When this strategy is used, it requires no inventory investment, overtime, or undertime.
* The drawbacks are the expense of continually adjusting workforce levels, potential alienation of the workforce, loss of productivity and quality because of constant change in the workforce.

**level strategy**: a strategy that keeps the workforce constant, but varies its utilization via overtime, undertime, and vacation planning to match the demand forecast

**mixed strategy**: a strategy that covers the full range of supply options

* The two "pure" strategies used alone do not typically yield the best sales and operation plan.

Sales and Operation plans must consider relevant constraints and costs.

* Physical constraints like machine capacities that limit maximum output or inadequate inventory space
* Policy restraints could include limitations on number of backorders or use of subcontractors or overtime
* Ethical issues like excessive layoffs or required overtime.

## Chapter 11: Resource Planning

**master production schedule (MPS)**: a part of the material requirements plan that details how many end items will be produced within specified periods of time

* Breaks the sales and operations plans into specific product schedules.
* Must have the following aspects:
  * Sums of the quantities in the MPS must equal those in the sales and operations plan.
  * The production quantities must be allocated efficiently over time.
  * Capacity limitations and bottlenecks may determine the timing and size of MPS quantities.

### MRP and the Environment

* Consumer and governmental concern over the deterioration of the natural environment has driven manufacturers to reengineer their process to become more environmentally friendly
* Wastes come in many forms:
  * Effluents (i.e. carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and hazardous chemicals associated with the processes used to manufacture the product)
  * Materials, such as metal shavings, oils, and chemicals associated with specific operations
  * Packaging materials, such as unusable cardboard and plastics associated with certain products or purchased items
  * Scrap associated with unusable products or component defects generated by the manufacturing process

### Enterprise Resource Planning

**enterprise process**: a companywide process that cuts across functional areas, business units, geographical regions, and product lines

**enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems**: large, integrated information systems that support many enterprise processes and data storage needs

* allows an organization to view its operations as a whole rather than having to try to put together the different information pieces produced by its various functions and divisions
* They are usually designed in the following ways:
  * Revolves around a single comprehensive database that can be made available across the entire organization
  * Security restricts personnel to only access certain parts
  * Database collects data and feeds it into various modular applications
  * Streamlines data flows.
* Find ERP systems work best when implementation is simple, work with a small number of vendors, and use standardized systems rather than customizing

### Resource Planning for Service Providers

* Service organizations must focus on maintaining the capacity to serve their customers.

**bill of resources (BOR)**: a record of a service firm's parent-component relationships and all of the materials, equipment time, staff, and other resources associated with them, including usage quantities
