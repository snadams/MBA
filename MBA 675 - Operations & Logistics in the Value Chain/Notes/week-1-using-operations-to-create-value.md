## Chapter 1: Using Operations to Create Value

**operations management**: the systematic design, direction, and control of processes that transform inputs into services and products for internal, as well as external, customers

**process**: any activity or group of activities that takes one or more inputs, transforms them, and provides one or more outputs for its customers

**operation**: a group of resources performing all or part of one or more processes

**supply chain**: an interrelated series of processes within and across firms that produces a service or product to the satisfaction of customers

**supply chain management**: the synchronization of a firm's processes with those of its suppliers and customers to match the flow of materials, services, and information with customer demand

The three mainline functions of any business are:

* Operations
  * Transforms materials and service inputs into product and service outputs
* Marketing
  * Produces sales revenue from the outputs
* Finance
  * Generates resources, capital, and funds

Other functions like IT, HR, and engineering make the firm complete as supporting functions.

A process view of a firm provides a much more relevant picture of the way firms actually work, than by departments.

* Processes are made up of inputs and outputs. Inputs are workers, managers,equipment, materials, facilities, energy, etc. Outputs are goods and services.
* **nested process**: the concept of a process within a process

Two types of processes are service and manufacturing. Their primary difference are:

* the nature of their output
  * If a process doesn't change the properties of a material in the following dimensions, it is considered a service process:
    * physical properties
    * shape
    * size
    * surface finish
    * joining parts and materials
* the degree of customer contact
  * Services tend to have more contact with customers than manufacturing.

Manufacturing processes are also typically have longer response times, more capital-intensive, and easier to measure quality.

**core process**: set of activities that delivers value to external customers

### Four Core Processes

1. *Supplier relationship process*. A process that selects the suppliers of services, materials, and information and facilitates the timely and efficient flow of these items in to the firm.
2. *New service/product development process*. A process that designs and develops new services or products from inputs received from external customer specifications or from the market in general through the customer relationship process.
3. *Order fulfillment process*. A process that includes the activities required to produce and deliver the service or product to the external customer.
4. *Customer relationship process*. A process that identifies attracts and builds relationships with external customers and facilitates the placement of orders by customers.

**support process**: a process that provides vital resources and inputs to the core processes and therefore is essential to the management of the business.

### Operations Strategy

**operations strategy**: the means by which operations implements the firm's corporate strategy and helps to build a customer-driven firm

Developing a corporate strategy involves four considerations:

1. Environmental scanning
   * process by which managers monitor trends in the environment (i.e. industry, marketplace, society)
   * Done to stay ahead of the competition.
2. Identifying and developing the firm's core competencies
   * **core competencies**: the unique resources and strengths that an organization's management considers when formulating strategy
   * Includes workforce, facilities, market and financial know-how, and systems and technology
3. Developing the firm's core processes
   * Should be driven by core competencies. Evaluate competencies to focus on the processes that provide the firm its greatest competitive strength.
4. Developing the firm's global strategies
   * This can be done through strategic alliances or locating abroad.

### Market Analysis

* Market analysis divides the firm's customers into market segments and then identifies the needs of each segment.
  * **market segmentation**: the process of identifying groups aof customers with enough in common to warrant the design and provision of services or products that the group wants and needs
  * Market needs include both tangible and intangible attributes like:
    * Service or product needs
    * delivery system needs
    * volume needs
    * Other needs like reputation, number of years in business, etc.

### Competitive Priorities and Capabilities

**competitive priorities**: critical dimensions that a process or supply chain must possess to satisfy its internal or external customers, both now and in the future

1. **low-cost operations (COST)**: delivering a service or a product at the lowest possible cost to the satisfaction of external or internal customers of the process or supply chain
2. **top quality (QUALITY)**: delivering an outstanding service or product
3. **consistent quality (QUALITY)**: producing services or products that meet design specifications on a consistent basis
4. **delivery speed (TIME)**: quickly filling a customer's order
5. **on-time delivery (TIME)**: meeting delivery-time promises
6. **development speed (TIME)**: quickly introducing a new service or a product
7. **customization (FLEXIBILITY)**: satisfying the unique needs of each customer by changing service or product designs
8. **variety (FLEXIBILITY)**: handling a wide assortment of services or products efficiently
9. **volume flexibility (FLEXIBILITY)**: accelerating or decelerating the rate of production of services or products quickly to handle large fluctuations in demands

   * Management typically emphasizes a cluster of competitive priorities together.
   * **time-based competition**: a strategy that focuses on the competitive priorities of delivery speed and development speed

**competitive capabilities**: the cost, quality, time, and flexibility dimensions that a process or a supply chain actually possesses and is able to deliver.

**order winner**: a criterion customers use to differentiate the services or products of one firm from those of another

* Can include price, quality, time, and flexibility

**order qualifier**: minimal level required from a set of criteria for a firm to do business in a particular market segment

* Fulfilling the qualifier does not ensure competitive success, it just positions the firm to compete, i.e. gets them in the door
* Cars like the Yugo that had an order winner of very low price could not compete because it not maintain the minimal level of quality, consistency, and reliability.
* It is only worth investing in a qualifier up to the customer threshold. Anything beyond that yields a lower ROI.

### Addressing Trends and Challenges in Operations Management

**productivity**: the value of outputs (services and products) produced divided by the values of input resources (wages, costs of equipment, etc.)

* Managers usually measure productivity through labor productivity (index of of the output per person or per hour worked) or machine productivity.

## Supplement A: Decision Making

**break-even quantity**: the volume at which total revenues equal total costs

**break-even analysis**: the use of the break-even quantity; it can be used to compare processes by finding the volume at which two different processes have equal total costs

* All costs are divided into two categories, variable and fixed costs.

**preference matrix**: table that allows the manager to rate an alternative according to several performance criteria

* each score is weighted according to perceived importance
* allows for quantitative and qualitative performance criteria

**decision theory**: a general approach to decision making when the outcomes associated with alternatives are often in doubt

* This allows you to examine decisions under three situations: certainty, uncertainty, and risk.

### Decision Theory Process

1. List the feasible alternatives.
2. List the events that have an impact on the outcome of the choice but are not under the manager's control.
3. Calculate the payoff for each alternative in each event.
   * **payoff table**: a table that shows the amount for each alternative if each possible event occurs
4. Estimate the likelihood of each event, using past data, executive opinion, or other forecasting methods.
5. Select a decision rule to evaluate the alternatives, such as choosing the alternative with the lowest expected cost.

What if a manager can list the possible events but cannot estimate the probability? Managers can use one of four decision rules.

1. **Maximin.** Choose the alternative that is the "best of the worst" (pessimist).
2. **Maximax.** Choose the alternative that is the "best of the best" (optimist).
3. **Laplace.** Choose the alternative with the best weighted payoff (realist).
4. **Minimax Regret.** Choose the alternative with the best "worst regret".
   * Calculate the regrets (difference between a given payoff and the best payoff in the same column) and choose the smallest.

**decision tree**: a schematic model of alternatives alternatives available to the decision maker, along with their possible consequences
