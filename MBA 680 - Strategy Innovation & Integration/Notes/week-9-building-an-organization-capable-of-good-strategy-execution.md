## Chapter 10: Building an Organization Capable of Good Strategy Execution

* In a study of 400 CEOs in US, Europe, and Asia, executional excellence was the number one challenge facing their companies.
* Good strategy execution requires a *team effort*.

### A Framework for Executing Strategy

#### The Principal Managerial Components of the Strategy Execution Process

1. Staffing the organization and developing the resources, capabilities, competencies, and organizational structure to execute strategy successfully.
2. Allocating the needed financial and organizational resources to execution-critical value chain activities.
3. Ensuring that policies and procedures facilitate rather than impede strategy execution.
4. Adopting best practices and employing process management tools to drive continuous improvement in how value chain activities are performed.
5. Installing information and operating systems that enable company personnel to carry out their strategic roles proficiently.
6. Tying rewards and incentives directly to the achievement of strategic and financial performance targets.
7. Instilling a corporate culture that promotes good strategy execution.
8. Exercising strong leadership to drive the execution process forward and attain companywide operating excellence as rapidly as feasible.

To devise an agenda for implementing and executing strategy, managers must assess what the organization must do differently and better to execute the strategy proficiently.

* Then they must determine precisely how to make the necessary internal changes.
* Role of CEO/senior executives vary with size of organization and sprawl of geographic locations.
  * The larger an organization or the farther away from employees, the more important middle management comes to undertake necessary changes.

### Building an Organization of Good Strategy Execution: Three Key Actions

#### Staffing the Organization

* Putting together a talented management team with the right mix of experiences, skills, and abilities to get things done is one of the first steps in launching the strategy execution process.
  * Great when they are change agents (ability to champion and trigger change)
  * Get the right managers on the bus (and the wrong ones off) before trying to drive the bus in the desired direction.
* It is difficult for a company to competently execute its strategy and achieve operating excellence without recruiting and retaining a large band of capable, engaged, high-achieving employees.
  * Some practices that are used to find and retain these employees include:
    * Spend effort in screening and evaluating job applicants, selecting only those who are capable for the work environment and culture
    * Put employees through training programs that continue throughout their careers
    * Providing promising employees with challenging, interesting, and skill-stretching assessments
    * Rotating people through jobs that not only have great content but span functional and geographic boundaries.
    * Promotions, salary increases, performance bonuses, stock options, fringe benefit packages
    * Coaching average performers to improve while weeding out underperformers and benchwarmers

#### Developing and Strengthening the Resources and Capabilities Important to Good Strategy Execution

* If a strategy has new elements, company managers may have to acquire new resources, significantly broaden or deepen certain capabilities, or develop entirely new capabilities in order to put the new strategic initiatives in place.
* Even if strategy doesn't change much, good strategy execution still involves ongoing efforts to polish and upgrade the firm's resources and capabilities.
* The most common approaches to capability building are:
  * Developing and strengthening capabilities internally
    * **STAGE 1:** Managers set an objective of developing a particular capability and organization activity around that objective.
      * Often a slow, complex process that entails coordinated efforts on the part of multiple departments.
      * Requires trial and error and progress tends to be irregular, coming in bursts.
    * **STAGE 2:** As experience grows, the ability evolves into a tried-and-true capability or proven competence.
      * If capability is a key part of executing the company's strategy, qualifies as a core competence and competitively valuable capability.
    * **STAGE 3:** Involves an ongoing effort to polish, refine, and sharpen the performance of a capability/competence, aiming for best-in-industry or best-in-world proficiency
      * To better than rivals
      * Few companies reach this stage
  * Acquiring needed capabilities through mergers and acquisition
    * Can shortcut the time and energy needed to develop internally, which may be important when:
      * A market opportunity can slip by a faster than a needed capability can be created internally
      * When industry conditions, technology, or competitors are moving at such a rapid cip that time is of the essence
  * Developing new capabilities via collaborative partnerships
    * There are three basic ways to obtain needed capabilities via collaboration with outsiders.
      * Outsource a capability-deficient to a key supplier or another provider having attractively strong capabilities
        * Good when function is not strategically critical
      * Work collaboratively with key suppliers to achieve such valuable and mutually beneficial capabilities as just-in-time inventory management, speedy design and delivery of parts and components for new products, and defect-free or more durable parts and components
      * Establish a collaborative partnership with a firm outside the industry having the desired capability the company needs to build and develop for its own internal use.
* Competencies/capabilities grow stale unless they are refreshed, modified, or even phased out and replaced to stay abreast of ongoing changes in customer needs and expectations.
* A superior capability to execute strategy better than rivals is the only path to sustainable competitive advantage when rivals can readily copy the successful features of a company's product and its actions to attract customers.

#### Structuring the Organization and Work Effort

* An import component to structuring the organization is knowing which value chain to perform internally and which to outsource.
  * Outsourcing can lead to lower costs, a heightened strategic focus, less internal bureaucracy, speedier decision making, and a better arsenal of competencies and capabilities.
  * Heightened focus can:
    * Improve the chance to outclass rivals in the performance of strategy-critical activities and turn a core competence into a distinctive competence
  * Must avoid going overboard and becoming overly dependent on outside suppliers.
* Make strategy-critical value chain activities the main building blocks of the organization structure.
* How much authority should be delegated?
  * Centralized decision making
    * Decisions should be pushed up to managers up the line, employees don't have the know-how, temperament, or judgment to make decisions
    * Pros
      * Easy to know who is accountable when things do not go well
      * Facilitates strong leadership from the top in a crisis situation
      * Reduces potential for conflicting decisions and actions among lower-level managers
    * Cons
      * Do not encourage responsibility and initiative on the part of lower-level manager and employees
      * Make an organization sluggish in responding to changing conditions because of red tape and bureaucracy
      * Difficult to gather relevant information at lower levels because of distance
  * Decentralized decision making
    * Decision making should be put in the hands of the people closest to, and most familiar with, the situation
    * Pros
      * Encourages employees to exercise initiative and act responsibility
      * Spurs new ideas and creative thinking
      * Allows fast response times
      * Entails fewer layers of management
    * Cons
      * Management lacks "full control"
      * Puts the organization at risk if empowered employees at lower levels in the organization happen to make *bad* decisions
      * Can impair cross-unit collaboration because of independence of empowered employees
* Getting managers of execution-critical activities to voluntarily but conscientiously live up to their promises and commitments to coordinate closely with sister organizational units turns out to be the *key* factor in achieving good internal cross-unit coordination.
  * May require cross-functional committees, project management teams if done poorly
