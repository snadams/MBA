## Chapter 11 - Managing Internal Operations: Actions That Promote Good Strategy Execution

### Allocating Needed Resources to Execution-Critical Activities

* Requires steering the proper kinds and amounts of resources to the enterprise's various organization units and strategy-critical value chain activities.
  * Too little funding slows progress and impedes the efforts of organizational units.
  * Too much funding wastes organizational resources and reduces financial performance.
* Visible actions to reallocate operating funds and increase/decrease the staffing of certain organizational units give credibility to management's intent to institute internal change and signal company personnel to exhibit a sense of urgency in putting the new strategy elements into place and/or improving the performance of activities essential to better strategy execution.

### Ensuring That Policies and Procedures Facilitate Strategy Execution

* A company's policies and procedures provide guidance for conducting particular aspects of the company's business and a set of white lines and routines for steering employee's behavior.
* Can facilitate strategy execution in three ways:
  * By providing top-down guidance regarding how certain things need to be done.
    * Place boundaries to avoid ineffective or unwanted actions
    * Clarify uncertainty about how to proceed
    * Represent management's best judgement on how to do things
    * Can also be a barrier to executing strategic initiatives, where they must be changed
  * By helping enforce needed consistency in how execution-critical activities are performed in geographically scattered operating units.
    * Used for standardization in the way activities are performed.
    * Eliminate significate differences in the operating practices of different plants, sales regions, customer-service centers, etc.
  * By promoting the creation of a work climate that facilitates good strategy execution.
    * Use as a lever for changing the corporate culture in ways that better support new strategic initiatives and/or new efforts to improve strategy execution
* Prescribe enough policies to give organization members clear direction and to place reasonable boundaries on their actions, then empower them to act within these boundaries however they think makes sense.

### Adopting Best Practices and Employing Process Management Tools to Improve Execution

* Managerial efforts to identify and adopt best practices are a powerful tool for promoting operating excellence and better strategy execution.
* **best practice**: the method of performing an activity or business practices that yields superior results compared to other approaches
  * In lowering costs, improving quality or performance, shortening time requirements, enhancing safety, etc.
  * Can evolve over time as improvements are discovered
* **benchmarking**: measuring hwo well a company's own performance of an activity stacks up against the best-practice standard
* Implementing use of best practices across a company's entire value chain is a powerful way for managers to push a company along the path to operating excellence and good strategy execution.
* **business process reengineering**: radically redesigning and streamlining how an activity is performed, with the intent of achieving quantum improvements in performance
* **total quality management (TQM)**: management approach that emphasizes continuous improvement in all phases of operations, 100 percent accuracy in performing tasks, involvement and empowerment of employees at all levels, team-based work design, benchmarking, and total customer satisfaction
  * Aims at instilling enthusiasm and commitment to doing things right from the top to the bottom of the organization
* Six Sigma programs use advanced statistical methods to enable an activity or process to be performed with `99.9997` percent accuracy - fewer than 3.4 defects per million iterations.
  * Based on three principles:
    * All work is a process
    * All processes have variability
    * All process create data that explains variability
* Business process reengineering aims at quantum gains of 30 to 50 percent while TQM and Six Sigma stress *ongoing incremental improvements*.

### Installing Information and Operating Systems

* State-of-the-art operating systems and real-time data are integral to competent strategy execution and operating excellence.
* Information systems need to cover five broad areas:
  * Customer data
  * Operations data
  * Employee data
  * Supplier/strategic partner data
  * Financial performance data
* Good to track and report in real-term, or at worse weekly to stay on top of implementation initiatives and daily operations

### Tying Rewards and Incentives to Achieving Good Performance Outcomes

* A well designed reward structure is management's single most powerful tool for mobilizing organizational commitment to successful strategy execution.
* No one-size-fits-all. The more understanding managers have about how to really motivate company personnel and the greater the reliance they place on using monetary and non-monetary incentives as a tool for producing good results, the greater the employees' commitment to good strategy execution and achieving the targeted performance outcomes.
* Monetary rewards typically include base pay increases, performance bonuses, stock awards, company contribution to employee retirement plan, etc.
* Non-monetary rewards include
  * Attractive perks and fringe benefits (on-site child care, generous vacation time, college tuition reimbursement, subsidized cafeteria, etc.)
  * Relying on promotion from within whenever possible.
  * Inviting and acting on ideas and suggestions from employees
  * Giving awards and public recognition to high performers and showcasing company successes
  * Creating a work atmosphere in where there is genuine sincerity, caring, and mutual respect among workers
  * Stating the strategic vision in inspirational terms that make employees feel they are a part of doing something worthwhile in a larger social sense
  * Providing an appealing workplace environment
* Management should focus more on positive motivational elements than negative as it can adversely impact workforce morale and strategy execution.
* Incentives must be based on accomplishing the right results, not on dutifully performing assigned tasks.
