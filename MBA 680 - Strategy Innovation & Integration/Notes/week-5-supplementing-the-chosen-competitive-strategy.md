## Chapter 6: Supplementing the Chosen Competitive Strategy - Other Important Strategy Choices

Once a company has settled on which of the five generic competitive strategies to employ, attention turns to what strategic actions it can take to complement its competitive approach and maximize the power of its overall strategy. The following sections will cover the pros/cons of each of the strategy-enhancing measures.

### Going on the Offensive - Strategic Options to Improve a Company's Market Position

**strategic offensives**: when a company sees opportunity to gain profitable market share at rivals' expense

* Best to challenge rivals on their weakness, rather than their strength where it could be an uphill battle.
* Principal offensive strategies include:
  * Offering an equally good or better product at a lower price
    * Best if company first achieves cost advantage and then hits competitors with a lower price
  * Leapfrogging competitors by being the first adopter of next-generation technologies or being first to market with next-generation products
  * Pursuing continuous product innovation to draw sales and market share away from rivals with comparatively weak product innovation capabilities
  * Pursuing disruptive product innovation to create new markets
  * Adopting and improving on the good ideas of other companies (rivals or otherwise), not nailed down by a patent
  * Deliberately attacking those market segments where a key rival makes big profits
  * Attacking the competitive weakness of rivals (i.e. features, quality, performance)
  * Maneuvering around competitors and concentrating on capturing unoccupied or less contested market territory
    * Southwest became a major carrier by focusing on lesser-sized airports and away from big "hubs"
  * Using hit-and-run guerilla warfare tactics to grab sales and market share from complacent or distracted rivals
  * Launching a preemptive strike to secure an advantageous position that rivals are prevented or discouraged from duplicating
    * securing the best distributors in a particular geographic region or country
    * tying up the most reliable, high-quality suppliers via exclusive partnerships, long-term contracts, or acquisition

**blue ocean strategy**: inventing a new industry or distinctive market segment that renders existing competitors largely irrelevant and allows a company to create and capture altogether new demand

* Ebay created the online auction market, which did not exist beforehand.
* Uber/Lyft in ride-sharing services

#### Choosing Which Rivals to Attack

* Market leaders that are vulnerable
  * Unhappy buyers, inferior product line, commitment to aging technology
* Runner-up firms with weaknesses in areas where the challenger is strong
* Struggling enterprises on the verge of going under
* Small local and regional firms with limited resources and/or capabilities

### Defensive Strategies - Protecting Market Position and Competitive Advantage

**defensive strategies**: help protect competitive advantage but rarely are the basis for creating it

* The most common defensive strategy is to block avenues open to challengers, throw obstacles in their path.
  * Broadening product line, introducing features/models to close off gabs and vacant niches to opportunity-seeking challengers.
  * Thwart price-based attacks by maintaining a lineup of product selections that include economy-priced options for price-sensitive buyers
  * Lengthen warranties
  * Offer free training and support services
  * Volume discounts or better financing terms to dealers and distributors
* Signal challengers that strong retaliation is likely in the event of an attack to dissuade challengers from attacking or divert to less-threatening options
  * Publicly announce management's commitment to maintaining firm's present market share
  * Publicly committing the company to a policy of matching competitors' prices and terms of sale
  * Challengers must believe that the signaler has every intention of pursuing retaliatory actions if attacked.

### Website Strategies

* Should a website be used only as a means to disseminate information about the company and products? Or should it be online sales be:
  * secondary or minor channel for accessing customers
  * one of several important distribution channels for accessing customers
  * primary distribution channel
  * exclusive channel for transacting sales with customers
* Avoid channel conflict where the company is directly competing against its distribution allies with online product.
  * Results in angry dealers and loss of dealer goodwill
* Brick-and-click strategies have two big appeals:
  * Expanding a company's geographic reach
  * Give existing and potential customers another choice of how to communicate with the company, shop for product information, make purchases, or resolve customer service problems

#### Strategies for Online Enterprises

These are companies like Netflix, Amazon, eBay, Expedia. THe strategies adopted by these companies must address several issues:

* How it will deliver unique value to buyers
  * Low price, convenience, build-to-order options, attentive online service
* Whether it will pursue competitive advantage based on lower costs, differentiation, or better value for the money
* Whether it will have a broad or a narrow product offering
  * From Amazon to Quick Loans (largest online provider of home mortgages)
* Whether to outsource order fulfillment activities or perform them internally
  * May be more economical to specialists who provide warehouse space, stock inventories, etc.
* How it will draw traffic to its website and then convert page views into revenues

### Outsourcing Strategies

**outsourcing strategies**: involve a conscious decision to abandon or forego attempts to perform certain value chain activities and to instead farm them out to outside specialists and strategic allies

* Can be strategically advantageous whenever:
  * An activity can be performed better or more cheaply by outside specialists
    * Unless the activity is strategically crucial and internal control is deemed essential
  * The activity is not crucial to the firm's ability to achieve sustainable competitive advantage
  * It streamlines company operations in ways that improve organizational flexibility or speeds the time to get new products to market
  * It reduces the company's risk exposure to changing technology or shifting buyer preferences
  * It improves a company's ability to innovate
  * It allows a company to assemble diverse kinds of expertise speedily and efficiently
  * It allows a company to concentrate on its core business, leverage its key resources, and do even better what it already does best
* The biggest danger is that a company farms out too many or the wrong types of activities, which can narrow the scope of its capabilities in ways that unwittingly reduce its long-term competitiveness.

### Vertical Integration Strategies - Operating Across More Stages of the Industry Value Chain

**vertical integration**: extension of a firm's competitive and operating scope within the same industry, by integrating backwards into sources of supply and/or forwards toward end users

* The advantages of a vertical integration strategy are to strengthen the firm's competitive position and/or boost its profitability.
  * Has no real payoff with respect to profits or strategy unless it produces sufficient cost savings/profit increases to justify the extra investment, adds materially to a company's competitive strengths, and/or helps differentiate the company's product offering in ways buyers deem valuable.
* For backwards integration to be viable and profitable (not that easy):
  * Achieve the same scale economies as outside suppliers
  * Match or beat supplier's production efficiency with no drop-off in quality
* The biggest drawbacks of vertical integration are:
  * Boosts a firm's capital investment, thereby increasing business risk
  * Creates a vested interest for a firm to continue performing the integrated system of value chain activities it has invested money and effort into establishing
  * Some companies are slow to adopt new technologies or production methods because of the reluctance to write off undepreciated assets. The faster the pace of change in an industry's value chain, the bigger the risk of a vertical integration strategy.
  * Capacity-matching problems
  * Reduces company's flexibility to implement a cheaper/better product design

### Strategic Alliances and Partnerships

**strategic alliance**: collaborative arrangement where two or more companies join forces to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes

**joint venture**: entails forming a new corporate entity that is jointly owned by two or more companies that agree to share in the revenues, expenses, and profits

* Doesn't always make good strategic and economic sense to be totally independent and self-sufficient with regard to every resource and capability it may need
* A company racing to stake out a strong position in an industry of the future needs alliances to:
  * Establish a stronger beachhead for participating in the target industry
  * Master new technologies and build valuable expertise faster
  * Open up broader opportunities in the target industry
* Many alliances are short-lived or break apart.
  * Could happen from inability to work together, alliance members sharing limited information, changing conditions that render purpose of alliance obsolete
  * Failure rate of alliances between 60% and 70%

### Merger and Acquisition Strategies

**merger**: the combining of two or more companies into a newly created company that usually has a different name

**acquisition**: a combination in which one company, the acquirer, purchases and absorbs the operations of another, the acquired

* These strategies are usually used to achieve any of the following four objectives:
  * Creating a more cost-efficient operation out of the combined companies.
  * Strengthening the resulting company's resources, capabilities, and competitiveness in important ways.
  * Expanding a company's geographic coverage.
  * Extending the company's business into new product categories.
* Failure rate is between 70% and 90%

### Choosing Appropriate Functional-Area Strategies

* Decisions regarding R&D, production, human resources, sales & marketing, finance, are usually decided after the previous strategies.
* They typically are dictated by the choice of competitive strategy.
  * Low-cost provider strategy needs
    * R&D/product design that emphasizes cheap-to-incorporate features
    * Production strategy that stresses capture of scale economies
    * low-budget marketing strategy

### Timing a Company's Strategic Moves

**first-mover advantages/disadvantages**: competitive advantage can spring from when a move is made as well from what move is made

* Can have high payoff when:
  * Pioneering helps builds a firm's image and reputation with buyers
  * Create strong brand loyalty
  * An early lead leads a first mover to move down the learning curve ahead of rivals, establish an absolute cost advantage over rivals
  * A first-mover's actions are protected by patents, copyrights, or other forms of property rights, thwarting a response by would-be followers
* Disadvantages of moving first occur when:
  * When pioneering leadership is more costly than imitating followership and only negligible experience or learning-curve benefits accrue to the leader
  * When an innovator's products are somewhat primitive and do not live up to buyer expectations, allowing a follower to produce a better-performing "next-generation" product to win buyers
  * When buyers are skeptical about the benefits of a new technology or product being pioneered
  * When rapid market evolution gives fast followers the opening to leapfrog a first-mover's products with more attractive next-version products
  * When customer loyalty to the pioneer is low and a first-movers skills, know-how, and actions are easily copied or surpassed
