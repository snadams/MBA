## Chapter 2: Charting a Company’s Long-­Term Direction - Vision, Mission, Objectives, and Strategy

### What Does the Strategy-Making, Strategy-Executing Process Entail?

Crafting and executing a company's strategy is an ongoing process that consists of five interrelated managerial tasks.

1. Developing a strategic vision that charts the company's long-term direction, a mission statement that describes the purpose of the company's business, and a set of core values to guide the pursuit of the vision and mission.
2. Setting objectives and using them as yardsticks for measuring the company's performance.
3. Crafting a strategy to achieve the objectives and move the company along the path to accomplishing the mission and vision.
4. Implementing and executing the chosen strategy.
5. Monitoring developments, evaluating performance, and initiating corrective adjustments.
   * You revise as needed in light of the actual performance, changing conditions, new opportunities/ideas which feeds to the other four tasks.

#### Task 1: Developing a Strategic Vision, Mission Statement,and Set of Core Values

* Is the company on the right path or do changes need to be made to create opportunities for growth and opportunity?
* Top management's views and conclusions about the long-term direction and optimal product-market-customer-business mix seems optimal constitute a strategic vision for the company.

**strategic vision**: describes the route a company intends to take in developing and strengthening its business

* "Where we are going"
* Should feel distinctive and specific to the organization
* Should describe where the company needs to be headed, don't dwell on present
* Be sure the journey is feasible, should be able to make reasonable progress over time
* A strategic vision must be communicated. If it is not properly understood or accept the need, there is space for indifference or resistance.
  * Should be adequately stated in less than a page, and explained in 5-10 minutes.
  * Inspire subordinates to be excited to move the company in the proper direction
  * Creating a slogan helps distill the essence of the strategic vision even further.

**mission statement**: describes a company's business scope and purpose ("who we are, what we do, and why we are here").

* Typically identities products/services, specifies buyer needs it seeks to satisfy and market it serves, and gives the company its own identity
* Usually found in annual reports.
* Don't use phrases like "make a profit" or "maximize shareholder value" as those are objectives and the result of what a company does.

**core values**: the beliefs, traits, and behavioral norms that company personnel are expected to display in conducting company business

* Typically have 4-8 in values-conscious companies
* Connect strategic vision and mission statement together
* Can either be real and ingrained into the DNA of the company or seen as "window dressing" to look good to outsiders and have no bearing on the actual environment

#### Task 2: Setting Objectives

**objectives**: represent a managerial commitment to achieving particular results and outcomes

* Should be specific, measurable, challenging, and contain a deadline for achievement
  * Helps serve as yardsticks for tracking company performance
  * Motivate members to perform at high level and deliver best possible results
* Setting stretch objectives push organizations to be inventive and makes the work environment more exciting
  * Ho-hum objectives get you ho-hum results.
  * DOn't sett targets that carry no adverse consequences if actual performance falls short of targeted performance.

**financial objectives**: relate to the financial performance targets management have established for the organization to achieve

**strategic objectives**: target outcomes that indicate a company is strengthening its market standing, competitive vitality, and future business prospects

* Both types of objectives should have near-term and longer-term performance targets.
  * Short-term helps satisfy shareholder expectations on progress on a variety of fronts.
  * Longer-term prompts managers to consider what to do now to put the company in position to perform better later.
* Neither is more important the other. Good financial performance is not enough. An emphasis on both must be achieved in order to remain competitive and successful.
  * Financial performance measures tend to be *lagging indicators* that reflect the results of past decisions.
  * Strategic outcomes are typically leading indicators of future financial business performance and business prospects.
* Should extend to all organizational levels because each target contributes directly to the overall organizational goal.

**balanced scorecard**: combines the use of both strategic and financial objectives, tracking their achievement, and giving management a more complete and balanced view of how well an organization is performing

#### Task 3: Crafting a Strategy

*Masterful strategies come from doing things differently from competitors where it counts, rather than running with the herd.*

* Ultimate responsibility for leading the strategy-making, strategy-executing process rests with the CEO. Also fully accountable for the results the strategy produces, good or bad.
* Typically strategy is the product of more than just a CEO, but other senior executives who are the master of their respective domains.
* This also extends to lower levels as they are closer to the day-to-day operations of the company which is important for some strategic decisions.

##### Strategy-Making Hierarchy

* **Corporate strategy** concerns the overall strategy for managing a set of business in a multi-business enterprise.
  * Consists of whether to hold or divest existing businesses, strategic actions to boost the combined performance of the set of business the company has diversified into, etc.
  * CEO and other senior-level corporate executives
* **Business strategy** consists of the actions and approaches being employed to produce successful performance in one specific line of business.
  * Key focus is crafting responses to changing market circumstances and initiating actions to strengthen a business market's position and competitive capabilities.
  * Build or widen competitive competitive advantage
  * Improve the business's financial performance
  * Corporate-level executives exert strong influence, but usually governed by executive over the business.
* **Functional-area strategy** concerns the actions, approaches, and practices employed in managing particular functions within a business.
  * Functions like production, sales and marketing, customer service, finance, etc.
  * Lead responsibility is normally delegated to heads of the functions with the executive having final approval
  * Should be tightly aligned with business strategy
* **Operating strategy** concerns the relatively narrow strategic initiatives and approaches for managing key operating units (plants, distribution centers, geographic units) and specific operating activities with strategic significance (quality control, advertising, brand-building efforts, supply chain activities)
  * Limited in scope but add further detail to functional strategies and the overall business strategy.

*A company's strategy is at full power only when its many pieces are united.*

**strategic plan**: lays out future direction, business purpose, performance targets, and strategy

* helps cope with economic and market conditions, competing against rivals, and making progress along the chosen strategic choice

#### Task 4: Implementing and Executing the Strategy

* Most difficult and time-consuming part of the strategy management process
* Requires diligent pursuit of operating excellence

#### Task 5: Evaluating Performance and Initiating Corrective Adjustments

* This is the trigger point for deciding whether to continue or change company's vision and mission, objectives, strategy, and/or strategy execution methods.
* Over time, revisions are to be expected.
