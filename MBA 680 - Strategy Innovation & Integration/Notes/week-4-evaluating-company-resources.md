## Chapter 4: Evaluating a Company's Resources and Ability to Compete Successfully

### Techniques for Evaluating a Company's Internal Situation

#### Question 1: How well is the company's present strategy working?

* First thing to examine is company's competitive approach (i.e. what moves has the company made to attract customers and improve market position).
  * Advertising, cut prices, product design, features, etc.
* Three best indicators of how well a company's strategy is working is:
  * Whether the company is achieving its stated financial and strategic objectives
  * Whether the company is an above-average industry performer
  * Whether the company is gaining customers and gaining market share
* Run of the mill market results and mediocre financial results are red flags that raise questions about a company's strategy.
* Key financial ratios include:
  * Gross profit margin
  * Operating profit margin
  * Net profit margin
  * Total return on assets
  * Net return on total assets (ROA)
  * Current Ratio
  * Debt-to-equity ratio
  * Inventory turnover

#### Question 2: What are the company's important resources and capabilities, and do they have the competitive power to produce a competitive advantage over rival companies?

**resource:** any asset or productive input that a firm owns or controls

* Valuable or competitively relevant resources can relate to any of the following:
  * physical resources (i.e. land and real estate, plants, locations of stores)
  * human assets and intellectual capital
  * organizational and technological resources
  * financial resources
  * intangible assets (i.e. brand names, trademarks, copyrights)
  * relationships (i.e. alliances, joint ventures, partnerships with suppliers)

**capability**: the proficiency with which a company can perform an activity

* Can range from *struggling to perform an activity for the first time* to *being able to perform the activity with a level of competence that exceeds any other company in the industry*.
* The competitive value of a capability depends on two values, the competence a company has achieved in performing the activity and the role of the activity in the company's strategy.

**competence**: achieved in an activity when, over time, a company gains the experience and know-how to perform an activity *consistently well and at an acceptable cost*

**core competence**: an activity that a company performs quite well and that is also central to its strategy and competitiveness

**distinctive competence**: a competitively important activity that a company performs better than its rivals, i.e. *competitively superior capability*

* Being able to perform an active well does not necessarily give a company competitive clout. Some competencies only ensure market survival as most rivals have them.

**resource/capability bundle**: a group of resources and/or capabilities that, when linked and integrated into a functioning whole, has greater competitive value than the summed value of the individual components

Four ways to test the competitive power of a resource or a capability.

1. Does the resource or capability have competitive value?
   * The competitive value of a branch office for a bank is decreasing due to the growing use of direct deposits, ATMs, and Internet banking options.
2. Do many or most rivals have the same resource or capability?
   * Only gains value if resource or capability is rare or has sufficient competitive power to out-compete rivals.
3. Is the resource or capability or hard to copy?
4. Can the value of a resource or capability be trumped by substitute resources and capabilities of rivals?

**A company requires a dynamically evolving portfolio of competitively valuable resources and capabilities to sustain its competitiveness and help drive improvements in its performance. Otherwise, the power of its competitive assets grow stale.**

#### Question 3: What are the company's competitively important strengths and weaknesses and how well-suited are they to capturing its best market opportunities and defending against the external threats to its future well-being?

**SWOT analysis**: simple but powerful tool for sizing up a company's competitively important strengths and weaknesses, its market opportunities, and the external threats to its future well-being

**strength**: an asset that positively impacts competitiveness and ability to succeed in the marketplace

* Can be capability, core competence, valuable resource, achievements or attributes (i.e. market share leader, low overall costs related to competitors)

**weakness (or competitive deficiency)**: internal shortcomings that constitute competitive liabilities

* Can relate to inferior or unproven skills, expertise or deficiencies in competitively important physical, organizational, or intangible resources
* No company is immune from weaknesses.

Use the SWOT analysis to answer the following questions to learn about the company's overall situation:

* What are the attractive aspects of the company's situation?
* What aspects are of the most concern?
* Are the external threats alarming?
* Are the company's weaknesses of major or minor consequence?
* All things considered, on scale of 1 to 10, where does the company's overall situation and future prospects rank?

In order to translate the SWOT analysis results into effective strategic action, the four following conditions are necessary:

1. The foundation of a company's strategy to compete must be its most competitively powerful resources and capabilities.
2. The strategy must include actions to correct competitive weaknesses that make the company vulnerable to attack, depress profitability, or disqualify it from pursuing an attractive opportunity.
3. The company's strategy must include strategic initiatives aimed squarely at capturing those market opportunities best suited to the company's strengths and competitive assets.
4. The strategy should include efforts to defend against those external threats that can adversely impact the company's long-term business prospects or put its survival at risk.

#### Question 4: Are the company's prices and costs competitive with those of key rivals, and does it have an appealing customer value proposition?

Two telling signs of whether a company's business position is strong or precarious is:

* Whether its prices are justified by the value it delivers to customers
* Whether its costs are competitive with industry rivals delivering similar customer value at a similar price

**value chain**: identifies the primary activities it performs that create customer value and the related support activities

* The *outputs* of an organization's value chain activities are the value delivered to customers and the resulting revenue it collects.
* The *inputs* are all the resources required to conduct the various value chain activities.

**A company’s cost­ competitiveness depends not only on the costs of internally performed activities (its own value chain) but also on costs in the value chains of its suppliers and distribution channel allies.**

**benchmarking**: a tool for learning which companies are best at performing particular activities and emulating their techniques ("best practices") to improve the cost and effectiveness of a company's own internal activities

How does one create an advantage or remedy a disadvantage as concerns cost or the value delivered to customers?

* Improve the performance of internally performed activities.
  * Reduce costs.
    * Implement best practices throughout the company, particularly for activities where costs are higher than some or most rivals.
    * Redesign the product to eliminate high-cost components or facilitate speedier and more economical manufacture.
    * Outsource certain internal activities to vendors or contractors that can perform them more cheaply that can performed in-house.
    * Stop performing activities of minimal value to customers.
  * Enhance value.
    * Implement best practice approaches for activities affecting quality and customer service and activities known to affect buyer brand preferences.
    * Implement new design innovations that improve quality, curtail maintenance requirements, extend product life.
* Improve the performance of supplier-related value chain activities.
  * Pressure suppliers for lower prices.
  * Switch to lower-priced substitute inputs.
  * Collaborate with suppliers to identify mutual cost-saving opportunities.
* Improve the performance of distribution-related value chain activities.
  * Pressure distributors, dealers to reduce costs and markups to make final price to buyers more attractive.
  * Collaborate with forward channel allies to identify win-win opportunities.
  * Change distribution channels, sell directly via the internet or integrating forward into company-owned retail outlets.

#### Question 5: Is the company competitively stronger or weaker than key rivals?

How does a company rank relative to competitors on each important factor that determines market success? Does the company have a net competitive advantage or disadvantage versus its closest rivals?

##### Executing a Competitive Strength Assessment

1. Make a list of the industry's key success factors and the most telling measures of competitive strength or weakness.
2. Assign weights to each of the measures of competitive strength based on perceived importance.
3. Rate the firm and its rivals on each competitive strength measure (typically on a scale of 1-10, weak to strong).
4. Multiply each strength rating by its importance weight to obtain weighted strength scores.
5. Sum each company's weighted strength ratings to obtain an overall weighted competitive strength rating.
6. Use the overall weighted competitive strength ratings to draw conclusions about the size and extent of the company's net competitive advantage (or disadvantage) vis-a-vis its rivals. Take specific note of areas of strengths and weaknesses.

**A company’s competitive strength scores pinpoint its strengths and weaknesses against rivals and point directly to the kinds of offensive/ defensive actions it can use to exploit its competitive strengths and reduce its competitive vulnerabilities.**

#### Question 6: What strategic issues and problems does top management need to address in crafting a strategy to fit the company's situation?

The purpose of compiling a *worry list* that sets forth the strategic issues and problems a company faces is to create an agenda of items that needs to be addressed in crafting a set of strategic actions that fit the company's overall situation.

* *How to* reduce company's high costs and pave the way for price reductions
* *Whether to* expand the company's product line
* *What to do* to combat the aging demographics of company's customer base
