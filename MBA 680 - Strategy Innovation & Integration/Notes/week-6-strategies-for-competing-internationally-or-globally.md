## Chapter 7: Strategies for Competing Internationally or Globally

### Strategic Issues Unique to Competing Across National Borders

1. Whether to customize the firm's offerings in different country markets to match local buyer preferences or offer mostly standardized products worldwide
2. Whether to employ the same basic competitive strategy in all countries or to modify the strategy country by country to better match local market and competitive conditions
3. Whether to locate facilities, distribution centers, and service operations to realize the greatest locational advantages
4. When and how to efficiently transfer some of a firm's competitively powerful resources and capabilities from its operations in some countries to its operations in one or more companies

**international (or multinational) competitor**: a firm that competes in relatively few foreign countries

**global competitor**: a firm with operations on several continents, actively marketing its products/services in many different parts of the world, and is pursuing a strategy into additional countries, and pursuing a strategy of expanding into additional countries

* Typically start small by entering into one or two foreign markets (international) before expanding gradually (or rapidly) into more countries (global)
* Why do companies decide to enter foreign markets?
  * To gain access to new customers
  * To achieve lower costs and thereby become more cost competitive
    * Lower costs of labor
    * Avoid tariffs/duties on exported goods
  * To further exploit competitively valuable resources and capabilities
  * To spread business risk across a wider market area
    * Downturns in one market can be buoyed by increases in other ones
  * To meet their customers' needs abroad and retain their position as a key supply chain partner

### Why Competing Across National Borders Causes Strategy Making to Be More Complex

1. Important cross-country differences in buyer tastes, market sizes, and growth potential
   * Creating products/services tailored to markets:
     * Raises production and distribution costs
     * Appeals to local buyers
   * Greater standardization:
     * Scale economies
     * learning curve effects
     * Reduces production and distribution costs
2. Cross-country differences in wages, worker productivity, inflation rates, energy costs, taxes, and other factors that impact a firm's costs and profit prospects
   * Low-wage companies become attractive because of the varying wages across the world.
       * Virtually all manufacturing companies have facilities in China
3. Governmental polices and regulations that make the business climate more favorable in some countries than others
   * Some companies want to be "pro-business" while others want to make it difficult for foreign entities to locate facilities within a countries' borders to give domestic companies an advantage
     * Tariffs, quotas on imports of certain goods
   * Large corporations may be taxed to support/fund government programs that benefit disadvantaged
4. Risks of adverse shifts in currency exchange rates
   * Can pose significant risk because:
     * They are hard to predict because of the variety of factors involved and the uncertainty to which they will have an effect.
     * Shuffle the cards of which countries represent the low-cost manufacturing location and have cost-based competitive advantage because of where production operations are located
   * A weaker U.S. dollar is an economically favorable exchange rate shift for manufacturing plants based in the U.S. because
     * raises the U.S. dollar costs of goods manufactured by foreign rivals at plants located in countries whose currencies have grown stronger relative to U.S. dollar. Reduces or eliminates cost advantage foreign manufacturers may have had over U.S. ones.
     * Makes foreign goods more expensive in dollar terms to U.S. consumers, which stimulates demand for U.S.-made goods
     * Allows U.S.-made goods to be sold at lower prices in foreign countries whose currencies have grown stronger relative to U.S. dollar
     * Increases dollar value of profits a company earns in those foreign country markets where the local currency is stronger relative to the dollar
   * Disadvantaged when U.S. dollar becomes stronger

### The Concepts of Multicountry Competition and Global Competition

**multicountry competition**: exists when competition in one national market is not closely connected to competition in any other national market

* Features include:
  * buyers in different countries are attracted to different product attributes
  * sellers vary from country to country
  * industry conditions and competitive forces in each national market differ in important respects
* Winning in one country does not necessarily signal the ability to fare well in other countries

**global competition**: exists when competitive conditions across national markets are linked strongly enough to form a true international market and when leading competitors compete head-to-head in many different countries

* Features include:
  * Prices are strongly linked
  * Competitive position in one country both affects and is affected by its position in other countries

### Strategy Options for Establishing a Competitive Presence in Foreign Markets

1. Maintain a national (one-country) production base and export goods to foreign markets.
   * Advantages
     * Conservative way to test risks
     * Can increase utilization of existing capital investments
     * Minimizes direct investments in foreign countries
   * Export strategy is vulnerable when:
     * Home country manufacturing costs are higher than in foreign countries where rivals have plants
     * Product shipping costs to distant markets are too high
     * Adverse shifts occur in currency exchange rates
     * Importing countries impose tariffs or erect other trade barriers
2. License foreign firms to use the company's technology or to produce and distribute the company's product.
   * Makes sense when a firm:
     * Has valuable technical know-how
     * Desires to avoid risks of committing to unfamiliar, volatile and/or economically unstable markets
     * Can earn considerable royalties from licensees who are trustworthy and reputable
   * Safeguarding company's proprietary know-how is not as easy as it seems
3. Employ a franchising strategy in foreign markets.
   * Advantages
     * Franchisee bears in-country costs and risks of establish foreign locations
     * Franchisor only has to expend only the resources to attract, recruit, train, support, and monitor franchisees
   * Disadvantages
     * Maintaining quality control when franchises are not strongly committed to consistency and standardization
   * Should franchisee be allowed make modifications in product to better satisfy the tastes and expectations of local buyers?
4. Rely upon acquisitions or internal startup ventures to gain entry into foreign markets.
   * Acquisitions
     * Quicker than creating a new subsidiary and building from the ground up
     * Least risky and most cost-efficient means of hurdling entry barriers
     * Can move directly to tasks of transferring resources/personnel, integrating acquired firm into operations, putting strategy into place, building a stronger market position
     * Should you pay a premium price for a successful local firm or buy a struggling competitor at a bargain price?
   * Internal startup (greenfield venture)
     * Makes sense when:
       * creating subsidiary is less cost than making an acquisition
       * Can add the subsidiary's production to local market without adversely impact supply-demand balance in the market
5. Rely on strategic alliances or joint ventures with foreign companies as the primary vehicle for entering foreign markets.
   * Advantages
     * Enables a firm to benefit from a foreign partner's familiarity with local market
     * Facilities capture of economies of scale in production and/or marketing
     * Enables joint sharing of distribution facilities and dealer networks
     * Encourages partners in reaching agreement on important technical standards
   * Risks
     * Knowledge and expertise may prove less valuable than expected
     * Communication, trust-building, and coordination costs are high in terms of managerial time
     * Discord among cross-border allies
     * Become overly dependent on another firm for essential expertise and competitive abilities

### Competing in Foreign Markets: The Three Competitive strategy Approaches

**localized multi-country strategy**: a "think local, act local" approach

* Involve tailoring a company's product offering and competitive approach to match differing buyer preferences, market conditions in each country where it chooses to compete
* The bigger the variations from country to country, the more an international competitor's overall strategy becomes a collection of localized country strategy
* Well suited when:
  * Host governments enact regulations requiring products sold locally must be manufactured locally
  * Trade restrictions are so diverse and complicated, they preclude a uniform, worldwide market approach
* Advantages
  * Accommodates differing tastes and expectations of buyers
  * Grows global sales and market share by making product offerings more relevant
* Disadvantages
  * May raise production and distribution costs due to the greater variety
  * Not conducive to building a single worldwide competitive advantage
  * Handicaps a firm in using its resources, competencies, and capabilities to speed entry into additional country markets because the assets required in one country may differ than those in another

**global strategy**: a "think global, act global" approach, employing the same basic competitive approach in all countries where it operates

* Best suited for:
  * Promotes building a global brand name (with minor local adaptations when "necessary")
  * facilitates building and strengthening a collection of competitively valuable resources and capabilities ot underpin its global strategy
  * Enables tightly integrating and coordinating strategic moves worldwide
* Advantages
  * Enables capture of scale economies in manufacturing
  * Allows a company to focus on establish a global brand image and reputation
  * Facilitates concentrated effort on building a competitively collection of resources and capabilities to secure a sustainable low-cost or differentiation-based competitive advantage over local and global rivals

**hybrid strategy**: a "think global, act local" approach

* Entails using the same basic competitive theme but allowing local managers leeway to:
  * Incorporate minor country-specific variations in product attributes to better satisfy local buyers
  * Make adjustments in production, distribution, and marketing strategy elements to be responsive to local market conditions and to compete more successfully against local rivals

### Building Cross-Border Competitive Advantage

* Ways to gain competitive advantage (or counteract disadvantages)
  * Locate facilities and value chain activities in particular countries to lower costs or achieve greater product differentiation
  * Do a better job than rivals of efficiently and effectively transferring valuable competencies/capabilities across the borders where it competes

**Companies that compete internationally or globally can pursue competitive advantages in world markets by locating their value chain activities in whatever nations prove most advantageous.**

* Activities should be **concentrated** when:
  * The costs of manufacturing or other value chain activities are significantly lower in one location than others.
  * Significant scale economies in production or distribution are associated with a particular location.
  * Sizable learning and experience benefits accrue from performing an activity at a particular location
  * A certain location has superior resources, allows better coordination, or other valuable advantages
* Activities should be **dispersed** when:
  * They need to be performed close to buyers
  * High transportation costs, scale diseconomies, or trade barriers make it too expensive to operate from a central location
  * Strategically advantageous to disperse activities to hedge against exchange rate risks, supply interruptions due to weather, strikes or logistical delays, and averse political developments

### Profit Sanctuaries and Global Strategic Offensives

**profit sanctuaries**: country markets (or geographic regions) where a firm earns substantial profits because of its strong or protected market position

* Typically its home market, but not always
* Firms competing globally often have more profit sanctuaries than firms that only compete in a few country markets
* A domestic-only competitor has only one profit sanctuary
* Have an advantage of over firms without a protected sanctuary
* Offensive strategies a firm can employ with a profit sanctuary:
  * Attack a rival's profit sanctuaries.
    * **cross market subsidization**: entails supporting competitive advantages in one market with resources, capabilities, and profits diverted from operations in another market
    * Forces rival to devote attention to defending a market that is important to its competitive well-being and overall profitability.
  * Dump goods at cut-rate prices in the markets of rivals.
    * **dumping**: involves selling goods that are either well below the prices at which it normally sells elsewhere or well below its full costs per unit.
    * Has an appeal when:
      * Drives down the price so far in targeted country that local rivals are quickly put in dire financial straits
      * A firm with unused production capacity finds that it is cheaper to keep producing than to incur the costs associated with idle plant capacity
    * Can run a risk of host government retaliation through WTO on behalf of adversely affected firms.
